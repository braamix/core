// two halves are wired back to back here and pumped by hand.
//
// What that proves is the protocol — one message down, one up, the syscall
// relay, the exit status, the pool — and what it cannot prove is preemption,
// because Node is as single-threaded as the browser's kernel worker. So a
// program that loops is modelled rather than run: `hold` leaves a step
// undelivered, which is precisely what the kernel sees of a real one, and the
// terminate that answers it is counted.
//
// The shell is on the other end of one of these links too, and a
// permanent one: a link taken away here is a session rather than a command, and
// a `hold` that landed on the shell's pid would stop the driver dead.
