// Stdio backed directly by the cell grid, and the keyboard's routing table.
//
// The screen is not behind a byte channel: §2.3 says the terminal *is* a cell
// grid, so a queue in front of it would add a copy and a scheduling hop to
// reach an array screen_write already fills, and would put terminal output
// behind something that can drop.
//
// The keyboard is the other way round: it is one Channel with one receiver
// (channel.h), and that receiver is the console pump, for good (console.h). A
// program therefore does not take the keyboard — it asks the pump to route to
// it, which is what the claims below are, and the prompt is no exception.
//
// Each of the two routes — raw keys and the screen — has one holder at a time,
// kernel-side, named by the pid that took it. A second claim is refused with
// Err(Perm) rather than nested, and a claim clears the route only if it is
// still the holder, so two claimants may die in either order.
