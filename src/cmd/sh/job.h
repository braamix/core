// Running a parsed line: a pipeline of stages, the pipes between them, and the

// Every stage that is a program is a child of this process (Concept.md §4.3):
// `pipe` makes the channels, `spawn` moves an end into each child, `wait`
// collects them, and `kill` is what `kill %n` is. What the kernel used to do
// for the shell it now does *for* the shell, through the same five operations

// **130 is this shell's SIGINT**, which is 128 + SIG_INT. A status is the only

// and the stages are put in front so that ^C reaches them rather than us.
