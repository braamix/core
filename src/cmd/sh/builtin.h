// Shell builtins, under a rule with two clauses. The first: what touches this
// process's own state — its cwd, its job table, its loop — and so is not a
// file in /bin and never will be. A shell function is the same thing named by
// the user, and is looked up first.
//
// The second: **a command whose whole cost is the spawn.** A program costs an
// instantiation and a worker, roughly a millisecond (Concept.md §4.4), and
// `while [ … ]; do echo …; done` pays it twice a turn. It admits `test`, `[`,
// `:`, `echo`, `true` and `false` — a few lines each — and nothing else.
//
// **The file in /bin stays.** A builtin shadows the name at a prompt, not
// everywhere: /bin/test is what a future `find -exec` would run, and there is
// nowhere else to put it.
//
// **A builtin buffers its output and writes it once.** It runs in its turn
// rather than alongside, and a pipe holds eight writes of any size
// (PIPE_SLOTS, ../user/io.h), so a line at a time would fill one and park with
// nobody left to drain it. See Release_Notes.md for the rest of the reasoning.
//
// The table is an explicit sorted array: --gc-sections never extracts an
// archive member nothing references.
