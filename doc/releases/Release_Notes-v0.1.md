# Release notes — 0.1.0

Reasoning, alternatives and trade-offs behind the code released as 0.1.0.
Comments in the source say *what* a thing is; this file says *why* it is that
way. [Concept.md](../Concept.md) remains the specification — where this document
and the spec disagree about intent, the spec wins. The current release's notes,
and the index of the ones before it, are in
[Release_Notes.md](../Release_Notes.md).

## 0.1.0 — Packaging

`make release` packs `build/web/` into `build/braam-<version>.zip`. The version
string, which had read `0.1.0-m7` since M7 and predated two milestones, becomes
`0.1.0`: it names the archive now, so a stale one would be a stale release, not
merely a stale banner.

There was nothing to build. `build/web/` has been a complete deployment since M0
— every URL in it resolves against `import.meta.url`, so the tree works at any
path — and M7 made assembling it a target of its own. What was missing was one
archive to hand to a web host, and the whole of it is `tools/release.py` beside
`pack.py`, a custom target beside `serve`, and two lines of Makefile.

The archive nests under `braam-<version>/` rather than unpacking loose. A zip
that unpacks loose is unpackable only into a directory the deployer prepared and
named; a versioned one can be unpacked in a web root as it is, two releases
never collide on disk, and the directory says which one is serving. It costs the
deployer a `mv` when the URL must stay put, which is the smaller inconvenience
and a reversible one.

The version is read out of `src/kernel/version.h` by the script, at run time.
Reading it at configure time with `file(STRINGS)` was the obvious shape and is
wrong: editing a header does not re-run cmake, so the archive would go on
carrying the previous version until someone reconfigured — a silent error whose
symptom is a correct-looking file name.

Determinism is three lines — sort the entries, fix the timestamp at 1980-01-01,
fix the mode — and it buys the ability to answer "is what is deployed what I
built?" with `md5`. Without it two packs of one tree differ, so the question can
only be answered file by file after unpacking.

Nothing in the archive configures the server, and nothing needs to. Streaming
instantiation wants `application/wasm` and plenty of static hosts do not send
it, which `web/worker.js` has handled since M2 by falling back to a buffered
instantiate. That fallback is what makes "copy it anywhere" true, and it is why
there is no `.htaccess` in the zip to go stale against a host that never reads
it.

`LICENSE` travels with the site. The zip is a copy of the software in the sense
the MIT text means, and the notice is 1 KB.

## The milestones, and the criteria they were accepted against

The ten notes that follow are the *why* of M0–M9, one per milestone, written as
each landed. `doc/Milestones.md` was the plan they were written against — one
objective and a handful of acceptance criteria apiece, with a short note on how
each milestone departed from its plan. Every one of those departure notes is
stated at length below, and the arithmetic it carried (the size trajectory, the
program counts) is in the notes too, so what only it held was **the objectives
and the criteria**. Those are not history: a criterion is a standing behavioural
contract, and a change that breaks one is a regression however green the three
CTest cases are. So they are here, and the plan is deleted.

Twenty-two criteria, M0 to M9:

- **M0 — Nucleus.** Freestanding build, the coroutine shim, the allocator,
  `Str`/`Vec`, `host_log`, and a size budget from the first commit.
  - `make` produces a wasm binary with the Appendix C command line.
  - A static page loads a 4 KB wasm and logs a line to the console.
  - Size budget recorded (32 KiB) and enforced by CI.
- **M1 — Scheduler.** `Task<T>`, ready queue, wake tokens, `tick()`, `sleep_ms`,
  with `CancelToken` in every awaitable from here on.
  - Two coroutines interleave sleeps in the correct order.
  - Cancelling a sleeping task unwinds it and runs its destructors.
- **M2 — Screen and keys.** Cell grid, canvas renderer, damage rectangles,
  `Channel<Key>`, `OffscreenCanvas` transfer.
  - Typed characters appear on screen and the cursor moves.
  - Window resize reflows and `resize(cols, rows)` reaches the kernel.
- **M3 — Userland shell.** `LineEditor` with history and editing, tokeniser,
  program registry, argv, exit codes.
  - `echo hello` prints, `help` lists the programs.
  - Up-arrow recalls history; a nonzero exit code is observable.
- **M4 — Streams.** Stdio as channels, pipes, redirection, cancellation on `^C`.
  - `ls | grep foo` works.
  - `^C` interrupts a running pipeline and returns a prompt.
- **M5 — Filesystem.** Mount table, `MemFs`, `BundleFs` from a fetched archive,
  `OpfsFs` with the open-file table.
  - Write a file, reload the page, the file is still there.
  - `df` reports quota, usage, and ~~persistent versus best-effort mode~~ — the
    mode is on the boot banner now, since it is a property of the origin and not
    of a mount. **Amended**, not retired: see "df is a table".
  - ~~With OPFS unavailable, the system boots on `MemFs` and says so.~~
    **Retired**, not broken: there is no second store to boot on, and one that
    loses everything at the reload is the failure the criterion was written
    against. See "One store, and rootfs.zip".
- **M6 — Host services.** `fetch`, timers, WebSocket, clipboard, the `externref`
  table and `JsRef`.
  - A `curl`-ish command fetches a URL and prints the body.
  - A chat client works over a WebSocket.
  - `/mnt/import` and `export` move files in and out.
- **M7 — Depth.** A layout layer over the cell grid, job control, `/proc`-style
  introspection, an embedding API for host pages.
  - A full-screen editor opens, edits, and saves a file.
  - Jobs can be backgrounded and listed.
- **M8 — Isolated processes.** The §4.3 ABI, a `WebAssembly.Instance` per
  process, per-pid import closures, memory caps, a module cache, cross-boundary
  copies.
  - A program runs as its own instance with a 16 MB cap, and `memory.grow` fails
    past it.
  - A process cannot issue a syscall on behalf of another pid.
  - ~~Tier selection comes from binary metadata; userland behaviour is
    unchanged.~~ **Retired**, not broken: there is no selection left to come
    from anywhere. See "Tier 2 is deleted".
- **M9 — Liveness isolation.** A worker per process, `worker.terminate()` as
  `SIGKILL`, module `postMessage`.
  - `while(1){}` in an untrusted program is killable without reloading the page.
  - The shell stays responsive while such a program runs.

**Two changes since reach back through the whole list, and neither cost a
criterion.** The kernel applet and the program registry are gone, so where a
criterion says a program was registered that program is a binary in `/bin` and
`help` and `ls` read a filesystem — the criteria are about what the system
*does*, not where the code lives, and the ones that named `echo` and `sleep` as
applets are now met by binaries and checked by `test/run.mjs` rather than by the
in-wasm suite. And the tiers are gone, which retires exactly one criterion, M8's
third, as above.

**Where they are checked.** M0's budget is the `size` case and M1's pair is
checked twice — in `tests.wasm` against a fake clock and in `smoke` against the
shipping kernel. M5's persistence is mechanical too: `smoke` writes a file,
throws the instance away, builds a new one against the same JS-side store and
reads it back. Most of the rest are shell-level and much of what is scriptable
is driven by `test/run.mjs`; what is left — a resize reflowing, a chat between
two tabs, a picker moving a file in — is checked by hand at the prompt, which is
what a change touching one of them still owes.

---

## M9 — Liveness isolation

`while(1){}` is killable. A binary can ask to run in a Web Worker of its own,
and a process there is ended by `worker.terminate()` rather than by asking it to
stop — which is the one thing M8's isolation could not do, and the reason
Concept.md §4.2 exists. 236,965 bytes of `kernel.wasm` against an unchanged 256
KiB budget: **93 bytes**, which is the headline.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places — the §3 diagram, §4's tier prose, §4.2,
§4.3 and §4.4, and Appendix B — and none of them is structural.

### The ABI did not have to move, and that is the whole result

The obvious reading of M8's §4.3 is that tier 3 breaks it. `sys` is synchronous
and returns a value; a worker boundary has no synchronous direction, because §1
rules out `SharedArrayBuffer` and therefore `Atomics.wait`. The conclusion looks
like "tier 3 needs a second ABI", which would have meant two process runtimes,
two sets of binaries, and a tier that userland could see.

It does not, because the question is not *how does a process reach the kernel
synchronously from another thread* but *does it have to reach the kernel at
all*. Taken one at a time, none of the four synchronous calls does. `GetPid` is
a constant the host already binds into the closure. `Now` is a clock, and a
clock reading shipped with the step plus the worker's own elapsed time is a
better answer than a round trip would be. `Exit` is issued by `status_of`
immediately before returning, so buffering it onto the step's reply is not
merely equivalent, it is exact — tier 2 keeps the last `Exit` before the step
returned, and so does this. And `Stage` is not a program's syscall at all: it
exists so the *host* can ask for somewhere to copy into, and at tier 3 the host
doing the asking is the kernel's worker, which is on the kernel's thread.

So `src/proc/`, `src/cmd/` and the four exports are untouched, the same
`wc.wasm` runs at either tier, and the smoke test asserts one binary per tier
against the same import and export lists. The protocol between the two workers
is the *host's*, not an ABI: both halves of it live in `web/proc.js`, and
`web/procworker.js` is ten lines of wiring with no logic to drift.

`Stage` is answered `0` rather than assumed unreachable. A tier-3 process is the
untrusted one by definition, and "no program calls this" is not a property of a
binary somebody else compiled. Zero is the "no room" answer `proc_syscall`
already turns into `NoMemory`, so a binary that calls it gets a defined answer
instead of a hole. Unknown operations are refused locally for the same reason,
and never relayed.

### One message per step, not four

The first sketch had `sys_async` and `Sys::Exit` each post their own message,
arguing that a message port is FIFO so the kernel would see them in the right
order. It would have worked and it was still wrong: a suspension is *always*
immediately preceded by exactly one `sys_async` (there is one outstanding call
and `_resume` returns right after it), and `Exit` only ever precedes a return.
Both therefore fit on the reply to the step that caused them. Two messages per
syscall instead of four, no ordering argument to get right, and the kernel-side
relay is straight-line code in one handler — the same two lines as M8's
`sys_async` closure, with the source of the bytes changed.

### The kill needed no kernel code

M8 wrote that a tier-2 stage is a `Task<i32>` like any other and that the
destructor is the whole kill path. That turned out to be literally true across a
thread boundary as well: `^C` cancels the proxy, `~End` calls `proc_kill`, and
the host terminates a worker instead of dropping a Map entry. `jobs`, `kill %n`,
`/proc`, the tty pump and the stage epilogue needed nothing, and the kernel diff
is three edits — one line of `exec.cpp`, a tier argument on `proc_spawn`, and
four inline helpers in `sysabi.h`.

The one thing that *did* need writing is easy to miss and would have leaked
forever: **the in-flight step must be failed when the worker is terminated.** An
abandoned `HostReq` is freed by `host_orphan_reply` from `wake()`, and `wake()`
only happens if somebody answers — so a request whose worker no longer exists
has to be answered by the code that killed it. At tier 2 this happens for free,
because a queued step still runs and finds the pid gone.

Two smaller cases of the same shape: a worker that errors marks its process
crashed and drops its own link, so `kill` cannot hand a dead worker to the next
process; and `kill` after a *normal* exit is not a kill at all, because `exec`
kills every process it spawned, including the ones that exited. That is where
the finished worker goes back to the pool.

### The pool is the capability probe

Nested workers are not universal, and Concept.md already promised that a binary
asking for tier 3 runs at tier 2 where there is no worker for it. Making that
promise good needed somewhere to find out, and the pool was already going to
exist: one worker is hired at boot with no process in it, so a `Worker`
constructor that throws throws at boot rather than under the first `exec`, and
the first `exec` of a tier-3 binary costs an instantiation rather than a worker
start.

The pool saves worker startup and not memory — a process's sixteen megabytes go
when its instance does, not when its worker is recycled — which is worth saying
because the opposite is the natural assumption. Idle workers are capped at two.

### The tier on the wire, and the alternative not taken

`HostRequest` had no room: `flags` held both page counts and `aux` is the pid,
which is the one field that must not share. The tier went into the top nibble of
`flags`, with `proc_pack` / `proc_initial` / `proc_max` / `proc_tier` in
`sysabi.h` and a `static_assert` that the page counts still fit — the same shape
as `sys_op`'s descriptor packing, and mirrored in `web/proc.js` as `abi.js`
already mirrors `HostRequest`.

The tempting alternative was to let the host read the tier out of the `braam`
custom section itself, which it can: it holds the module, and
`WebAssembly.Module.customSections` is right there. Two ends reading the same
bytes provably cannot disagree. It was rejected because §4 says *`exec`* picks
the tier, and a host that picked it independently would leave the kernel unable
to say what it got — and the kernel is the thing that has to report `126` or
`132`.

### `spin`, and a loop the compiler was entitled to delete

`spin` exists to be un-killable by cooperation, and the first version of it did
not spin at all: an infinite loop with no side effects is not required to make
progress, and clang deletes it. A `volatile` counter is the fix and the comment
above it is the point of the file. `spin N` runs a bounded number of turns and
exits, so the tier's ordinary path — instantiate, write, exit — has a program
that exercises it without waiting for a kill.

`tail` moved to tier 3 as well, which is how the protocol is *checked* rather
than argued: `tail -n 1 /usr/share/motd | wc` is M8's own assertion, unedited,
now a tier-3 process feeding a tier-2 one through a kernel pipe. It buys that
coverage at 0.1 ms per 512-byte chunk, which is the tier's standing cost and the
reason it is a claim a binary makes rather than a default.

### What CI proves, and what it cannot

`test/run.mjs` is a straight-line synchronous driver — microtasks do not run
during it, which is why `step()` grew an explicit completion callback and lost
its promise. A real thread does not fit that at all, so `test/fakeworker.mjs`
wires the two halves of the protocol back to back over queues the driver pumps.
The whole protocol runs in CI: bind, step, the syscall relay, the exit status,
the pool, and the tier-2 fallback. Only the thread is fake.

Which means the one thing CI cannot prove is preemption, since Node is as
single-threaded as the kernel's worker. So a looping program is *modelled*: a
held step is one that sits undelivered, which is precisely and completely what
the kernel sees of a real one — no reply, no timer, and nothing to cancel but
the proxy. The assertions on top of that are the two acceptance criteria: `^C`
on a held process leaves `[130]`, terminates exactly one worker and leaves no
instance behind; and with one held in the background, `echo` and `jobs` still
answer.

The real thread was checked by hand, driving the shipping `web/procworker.js`
from `node:worker_threads`: `{k:"ready"}` on load, a bind and a step returning
`SUSPENDED` with a write of `spin: pid 7, spinning` — which is `GetPid` answered
inside the worker with the pid the host bound — then the reply that sends it
into its loop, no answer, and `terminate()` returning in 2 ms. That is the
criterion, once, outside a browser.

`dispose()` gained a handshake for the same reason. It used to terminate the
kernel's worker outright; a nested worker is specified to go with its parent,
but a leaked one is a core spinning for the life of the page, which is too much
to leave to a spec this code cannot check. The page now says so first and
terminates on the next turn as the backstop.

---

## M8 — Isolated processes

A program can now be a binary of its own, in a `WebAssembly.Instance` of its
own, with an address space, an `externref` table, a file-descriptor table and
sixteen megabytes that belong to nobody else — and the shell, the pipes, `^C`,
`jobs` and `/proc` do not know the difference. 236,872 bytes of `kernel.wasm`
against an unchanged 256 KiB budget, plus three binaries of 6–17 KB each.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places: §3.4 (two new exports and the record's
new word), §4 (tier selection, and what the unit tests can drive), §4.3 (the ABI
as built), §4.4 (the compile is not streaming) and Appendix B (how the copy
actually gets its destination).

### The rule the whole design turns on

**The kernel never calls a process, and the host never calls one while the
kernel is on the stack.** Everything else here follows from that sentence.

The first half is not a choice: wasm has no instruction that reaches another
instance, so only JS can call `_start`. The second half is: JS *could* call
`_start` from inside `host_svc`, the way `test/fakefs.mjs` answers a storage
request from inside the import — and that works there precisely because a reply
only queues. A process step is not a reply. It runs a program, and that program
immediately calls back in through `sys`, which allocates, touches the process
table and wakes a token. Doing that on top of a half-finished
`HostCall::issue()` is a class of bug that would show up as heap corruption
weeks later.

So one `_start` or `_resume` is a deferred host action, structurally identical
to a storage reply: the kernel's proxy task parks on a wake token, the host
steps the instance once the tick has unwound, and wakes the token with the
outcome. In `web/worker.js` that deferral is a microtask; in the test driver it
is an explicit `drain()` between ticks; the stepping code itself is the same
`web/proc.js` in both, because the difference is scheduling and not behaviour.

Synchronous syscalls run the other way and need none of this. `sys(pid, …)`
re-enters the kernel from JS at top level, exactly as `key()` and `wake()` do,
and answers without parking.

### The proxy task is the entire cancellation story

A tier-2 stage is a `Task<i32>` like any other. It spawns the instance, then
loops: step, and when the step reports "suspended", perform the syscall the
process is parked on and step again with the answer. The syscall is performed
*by the proxy, in kernel-land*, with the proxy's own `CancelToken`, against the
`Stdio` the job gave it — so a write into a full pipe is `Stream::Write`, a read
at end of input is `Source::Read`, and `^C` reaches a process through exactly
the awaitables it reaches an applet through.

That is why M8 adds nothing to the job runtime, the job table, `/proc` or the
tty pump. It is also why the destructor is the whole kill path: cancelling the
proxy unwinds it, and `~End` tells the host to drop the instance. A killed
process never unwinds — its coroutine frames, its heap and its descriptors go at
once, which is the isolation working rather than a shortcut. That is a strictly
better kill than an applet gets, and still not a *liveness* kill: a process in a
loop between syscalls is M9's problem, and nothing here changes that.

### No new import, two new exports

M5 fixed the style at one import per calling convention and M6 held to it.
Spawning, stepping and killing are asynchronous host operations with a request
record, which is `host_svc` exactly, so they are three more of its operations.
§2.2 still sanctions two synchronous exceptions and there are still six imports.

The two new exports are not the host's business at all: they are the process's
`sys` and `sys_async`, forwarded with a pid. That indirection is the capability
system §4.1 promised, and it is twelve lines of `web/proc.js` — the closure is
built per instantiation with the pid written into it, so *process 7 holds no
function that says 3*. The second acceptance criterion is not a check that runs;
it is a shape the ABI has, and what the smoke test asserts is the shape: the
module's imports are `env.memory`, `kernel.sys`, `kernel.sys_async`, and `sys`
has no argument a pid could go in.

`HostRequest` gained one word, `aux`. The alternative was to overload `flags`
and write the page counts into `result_lo` on the way *out*, which would have
made a reply field an argument field and saved four bytes.

### Memory is imported, so the cap is the kernel's

`-Wl,--max-memory=16777216` would also make `memory.grow` fail at 16 MB, and it
would be the *binary's* number. `--import-memory` with no declared maximum puts
it the other way round: the module says only what it needs to start with, and
the host supplies `new WebAssembly.Memory({initial, maximum: 256})`. A binary
cannot ask for more by being compiled differently. That is what §4.1 means by an
rlimit without cgroups, and `hog` is in `src/cmd/` to demonstrate it: it takes
64 KiB at a time until the allocator says no, gives one span back so it has
somewhere to put the coroutine frames that report the answer, and asks
`memory.grow` for one more page.

### The metadata is stamped after the link, not compiled in

`exec` reads the tier out of a `braam` custom section, which was to be a
`__attribute__((section(".custom_section.braam")))` global. It never reached the
object file — `used` keeps the compiler from dropping it but does not make it a
custom section here — and rather than fight the toolchain, `tools/stamp.py`
appends the section after the link.

That turned out to be the better place anyway. The section carries
`initial_pages`, which has to agree with `-Wl,--initial-memory`, and the stamper
is invoked from the same four lines of `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt` that set the
link flag. A number that must match another number should be written once.

### What the port of `wc` and `tail` proves, and what stopped `echo`

The third criterion is "userland behaviour is unchanged", and the honest way to
check it is to move a program and leave its tests alone. `wc` and `tail` moved
to `/usr/bin`; `echo 'a b' | wc` still prints `1 2 4`, `wc < notes` still prints
`2 2 8`, and `curl /hello.txt | wc` still prints `1 2 9` — M4's, M5's and M6's
assertions, unedited, now running an instance through a pipe, a redirection and
a fetched body.

`echo` and `sleep` were meant to move as well, and could not. The in-wasm unit
tests drive both — `echo` is `test_shell`'s workhorse and `sleep` is
`test_jobs`'s only timer — and `tests.wasm` cannot run a tier-2 program *at
all*: stepping an instance means returning to the host, and `run_tests()`
returns to the host exactly once, at the end. Porting them would have meant
rewriting two of the load-bearing unit tests around programs chosen to suit the
harness, which is the tail wagging the dog. The constraint is real and general,
so it is written into §4 rather than left as a note here: whatever `test/unit/`
runs has to stay an applet.

Two assertions in `test_shell` did have to move off `wc`, and both got better
for it: one now checks a pipeline by its output rather than by counting it, and
the other checked a hand-maintained count of programs whose names contain an
`e`.

### The syscall table, and the isolation this does not buy

Eight calls: `exit`, `getpid`, `now` and `stage` synchronously, `write`, `read`,
`open` and `close` asynchronously. Every one has a caller in `src/cmd/`; a
`sleep` syscall was written and then removed when `sleep` stayed an applet,
because a syscall nothing calls is an ABI nothing tests.

`stage` is the odd one, and it is the host's rather than a program's: the kernel
cannot be handed a buffer it did not allocate, so before copying a payload
across the closure asks for one. That is Appendix B's `Uint8Array.set` plus the
one thing Appendix B did not mention.

A descriptor is an index into the process's own table, so a number one process
holds means nothing in another. Paths are not: `open` resolves against the one
global cwd with the kernel's full authority, so M8 isolates address space,
memory and descriptors, and does not isolate the namespace. Fixing that needs a
per-process root and a cwd that is not a global, which is a milestone's worth of
work in the VFS and not a line in the dispatcher.

### Smaller decisions

- **`panic` is out of line now**, and takes `(ptr, len)` rather than a `Str`. A
  process has no host imports to log through, so it needs a different
  definition, which means the inline one had to go. The first version took a
  `Str` and cost 2,812 bytes: the wasm ABI passes an eight-byte struct
  indirectly, and there are a hundred call sites. Two scalars cost 55.
- **`stage()` in the job runtime takes a built `Task<i32>`** rather than a
  `Program *`, because a tier-2 body needs its pid and `sched_spawn` only hands
  one back once the task exists. The pid goes into the `Executable` the job
  owns, and the proxy reads it at its first resume — a tick later, since a
  `Task` is lazy.
- **The scheduler's name for a stage is `argv[0]`**, not `Program::name`, which
  a binary does not have. It is a view into the job's word store, which outlives
  every stage.
- **`help` lists `/usr/bin` too.** A program need not be in the registry to be a
  program, and what tier a name runs at is not something the listing should say.
- **A binary is re-read from the VFS on every `exec`.** The host caches the
  compiled `Module` by path, which is the expensive half, but the bytes still
  cross the VFS and one copy into the request record each time. Caching those
  too wants an invalidation story, and `/usr` being read-only is not one that
  generalises.
- **The bundle is staged rather than packed in place.** The binaries are build
  outputs and `/usr/bin/wc` has to be a plain name, so `build/bundle/` is a copy
  of `bundle/` with `bin/<name>` added, and that is what `tools/pack.py` packs.

## M7 — Depth

A program can take the whole screen and give it back, a job can outlive the
prompt that started it, the scheduler can be read as files, and a host page can
put a terminal on itself in six lines. Five new commands, one new library, and —
the part worth stating first — **no ABI change at all**: no new import, no new
export, and `test/run.mjs`'s exact-surface assertion is untouched. 225,784 bytes
of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in four places: §3.5 (the layout layer, the keyboard
claim, the saved screen, and re-wrap deferred), §3.6 (the job table, and the
scheduler's names), §5.1 (`/proc`) and §7 (`src/ui/`).

### One receiver, so the pump routes rather than yields

`Channel` has one receiver and a second suspended receiver silently displaces
the first. While a pipeline runs, that receiver is `tty_pump`, and the shell's
handshake at the end of `run_line` — cancel the pump, wait for its report —
depends on it. An editor that simply did `co_await keys().recv()` would displace
the pump, take `^C` with it, and race that handshake. The bug would not look
like a bug; it would look like the keyboard occasionally going dead.

So a full-screen program does not receive keys, it **claims a route through the
pump**: `KeyInput` gives it raw keys with the echo and the line discipline
turned off, and the pump `try_send`s into its ring. One mechanism covers three
cases that looked unrelated at the start of the milestone — the editor, the
pager, and `fg`, which needs the *cooked* bytes to go to a different job's stdin
and gets `InputClaim` for it.

`^C` is deliberately not routed. An editor could reasonably want it, but a
program that has taken the entire screen and stopped answering must stay
killable by the key that kills everything, and that is M4's acceptance criterion
as much as it is a safety rule. `edit` quits with `^Q` for the same reason, and
^C throws the buffer away.

The claim is RAII, which is what gives the route back when a claimant is killed
rather than asking it to be polite. M7 made it restore whatever was in force
before, on the reasoning that claims should nest; that was wrong, and "One
claimant, named by pid" above says why and replaces it with a single holder that
refuses the second.

### The single waiting slot decides the shape of `less` and of `fg`

`CancelState::waiting` is one slot, so a task cannot be parked on a pipe and on
the keyboard at once. This is the same constraint that pushed pipelines into
independent scheduler jobs in M4, and it shows up twice more here.

`less` therefore reads its input to end-of-input *before* it paints anything. A
real pager is lazy, and this one cannot be without becoming two coroutines and a
refcounted shared block — the `chat` pattern, which is 100 lines and a class of
lifetime bugs to buy laziness nobody asked for in a tab. It does claim the
keyboard first, before reading, so that what is typed while a slow pipe fills is
queued for the pager instead of being echoed at the shell.

`fg` never awaits keys at all. It parks on the adopted job's completion token
and lets the pump do the routing, which means ^C cancels *`fg`* — and `fg`'s
destructor passes that on to the job it adopted. Cancellation propagating
through a destructor rather than a branch is the same trick `run_line` and
`chat` use, for the third time.

### A background job is the same `Job`, with the reaper in the shell's place

`Job` was already a refcounted heap block, already outliving the frames that
point at it, already carrying its own `done` channel — M4 built it that way for
a different reason, and backgrounding needed almost none of it changed. What a
background job needs is somebody to stand where `run_line` stands: collect the
reports, record the status, drop the last reference. That is `reaper`, forty
lines.

Three details are not obvious. `CancelAll` gained an `armed` flag rather than a
branch around it, because it must still fire when setup fails partway. The
command text is *copied* into the table entry — `run_line` receives a `Str` into
the shell frame's line buffer, which is gone before `jobs` ever runs. And the
entry holds a reference of its own, because `fg` and `kill` reach the pipes and
the pids through it long after the shell moved on.

A background job gets no pump and its stdin is closed at once. Giving it the
keyboard would mean deciding which of several running jobs a keystroke belongs
to, which is what a foreground group is for; end-of-input is what a shell does
with `&` anyway.

There is no `bg` and no `^Z`. Suspending a running coroutine at an arbitrary
point is the resume-side twin of `CancelToken`: every awaitable would have to
consult a stop flag and every awaitable would have to be resumable without an
event. That is a milestone, not a command, and a stub that only ever printed
"not supported" would be worse than its absence.

Finished jobs are announced by the shell before the next prompt rather than
wherever they happen to end, which would otherwise land in the middle of a line
being typed. It is a coroutine of its own so that its locals stay out of
`shell()`'s frame, which has a size class to fit inside — the same reason
`boot_filesystem` is one.

### `Pane` writes cells, so the kernel grew `screen_touch`

`screen_cells()` has been public since M2 and writing through it marked nothing
damaged, so the renderer would not have repainted what a pane wrote. The
alternative was to route every pane write through `screen_put`, which moves the
global cursor, defers wrapping, and scrolls the whole grid when it reaches the
bottom — three behaviours a clipped rectangle must not have. One new function is
the smaller change, and `screen_touch(x, y, w, h)` is what any later direct
writer will want too.

A pane fills with blank cells — codepoint 0 — rather than spaces, since 0 is
what the grid means by empty and it still carries the pane's colours; that is
what makes a reversed status line one `fill_row` rather than a loop of spaces.

`FullScreen` copies the grid to a heap block and copies it back from its
destructor. If the geometry changed while the program ran, it clears instead:
the snapshot describes a grid that no longer exists, and pasting it back would
be worse than blanking. That path is tested, because it is exactly what a window
resize during `edit` does.

### `/proc` is flat, and generated at open

`BinFs` set the pattern in M5 and `ProcFs` follows it: a generated read-only
filesystem, so `cat` and `grep` are the introspection tools and there is no
second interface to keep in step with the first.

Two departures from Linux. The tree is flat — `/proc/42` is a file, not a
directory — because a process here has one line of state and a directory level
would hold exactly one file; if a process ever grows `cmdline`, `cwd` and `fds`,
that is the moment to add the level. And content is produced at `open` into a
heap block that the descriptor owns, so a file read in two blocks cannot
describe two different moments. `BinFs` could regenerate per read because a
usage line never changes; `meminfo` changes on every allocation, including the
ones `cat` itself makes.

The scheduler had to give up a little: a `Str name` on its private job record,
set at `sched_spawn`, and a `sched_procs` snapshot. The name is a view, so it
must outlive the task — a literal or a `Program::name`, never a local — and the
header says so. `sched_procs` returns nothing while `tearing_down` is set, for
the reason `find_job` does: `jobs[]` holds freed pointers while `~Sched` walks
it.

### The embedding API is an extraction, not an invention

`index.html` had 190 lines of module in it and nothing there could be imported.
Everything below it was already dependency-injected — `makeFsImports`,
`makeSvcImport`, `makeImports` all take their backends as arguments, which is
what the test fakes have been proving since M5 — so the page was the only layer
that was not.

`web/braam.js` exports one function, `mount({canvas, ...})`, returning a handle
with `focus()` and `dispose()`. The keyboard listener moved from `window` to the
canvas, which is the one behavioural change: an embedded terminal shares its
page, and two of them must not both read the same keystroke. `dispose()` exists
because a host that swaps views has to be able to let go — it terminates the
worker and drops every listener and observer.

The worker stays one kernel per worker. That is not a limitation to fix later;
it is the isolation model M8 builds on, and two terminals on a page are two
workers that share nothing but the origin's storage. `web/embed.html` runs
exactly that, with a different palette on the right-hand one to show that a
theme is an embedder's choice.

`E_PERM`/`E_IO`, which the page had been re-declaring as literals, now come from
`abi.js` like everything else on the wire.

### What the browser found, that no test could

The unit cases and the smoke test drive `kernel.wasm`; nothing drives the
shipping page. So the embedding API was checked in a real browser — headless
Firefox, a page reporting back through the HTTP log, and a screenshot taken
after a deliberately slow subresource delayed the load event. Two defects came
out of it, both older than M7 and neither reachable from Node.

**Boot waited on `navigator.storage.persist()`, which is not always quick.** M6
chose to block on it, reasoning that reporting the wrong durability is worse
than a tick of delay. That is right about the trade and wrong about the number:
Firefox took over five seconds to answer, and boot waited the whole time behind
a blank canvas. The page now sends a provisional best-effort answer after a 250
ms grace period and the real answer when it arrives, and the late one corrects
`OpfsStore.persisted` rather than boot — so `df` is right from the moment the
browser decides. With two terminals on a page it was worse than slow: a second
`persist()` issued while the first is outstanding did not settle until the first
had, so the second kernel never booted at all. Persistence belongs to the
origin, so the request is now made once per page.

**`build/web/` went stale on a web-only edit.** Assembling it was a `POST_BUILD`
step of the `kernel` target, so changing nothing but a `.js` file left
`make serve` serving the previous copy — which is exactly how the first defect
was nearly missed, since the fix under test was not the code being served. It is
its own always-run target now.

### Two things that did not land

**Re-wrapping logical lines on resize.** §3.5 promised it to "the layout layer
in M7", and the layout layer is the wrong place for it: re-wrapping needs to
know which rows are continuations of the row above, which is a bit `screen_put`
must set as it writes — inside the grid, below everything a pane can see. It
also collides with `LineEditor`'s anchor arithmetic, which infers scrolls by
comparing where a write should have ended against `cursor_y`. Doing it properly
is scrollback's problem and it will arrive with scrollback.

**A pane of `chat`'s own.** M6's notes said the layout layer is where an
interactive program gets one. It is, but only for a program that owns the
foreground: `chat`'s receiver is a detached task that outlives its parent, and
painting into a pane whose owner is gone is the same use-after-free as writing
into a pipe whose `Job` is gone. It still writes to the screen.

## M6 — Host services

The tab reaches outside itself: HTTP, WebSocket, the clipboard, the user's own
disk, and a clock that can name a day. Seven new commands, one new import, one
new export, and the `externref` table Concept.md §3.7 has been promising since
M0. 181,545 bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in six places: §2.2 (no third synchronous exception, and
why the new export is not one), §3.4 (`host_fetch` becomes `host_svc`, and `ref`
joins the exports), §3.7 (the table is real, and it points the other way), §5.1
(`/mnt/import`, and the bundle stays an archive), §5.4 (the escape hatch exists)
and §7 (`src/svc/`).

### The table is deposited into, not read out of

§3.7 described "a `WebAssembly.Table` of `externref` that wasm indexes into and
JS populates". Half of that is wrong, and the half that is wrong is the half
about JS.

`__externref_t` and the `__builtin_wasm_table_*` builtins work exactly as hoped
— reference-types is on by default for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so a
`static __externref_t table[0]` compiles and links with no extra flag. What does
not work is getting JS to that table: `import_module` and `import_name` are
function attributes, and clang rejects them on a table outright. An imported
table is not available, and exporting the module's own table means teaching
wasm-ld to export a table symbol.

Neither is needed, because an import may take an `externref` *parameter* and an
export may take one too. So the traffic runs the other way and JS never touches
the table at all:

- The kernel reserves a slot before it issues the request, and puts the number
  in the record.
- The host resolves its promise and calls `ref(slot, obj)`, the one new export.
- To use the object later, the kernel reads the slot and passes it as
  `host_svc`'s fourth argument. The host is handed the object; it never asks for
  it.

This is better than the sketch rather than merely equivalent. A host that cannot
index the table cannot reach an object the kernel did not deliberately pass out,
which is the property §4.1 wants from per-instance tables in M8 — and it comes
for free, since a module-defined table is part of the instance.

`ref` is an export, so §2.2 is untouched: the rule is about imports returning
data, and this returns nothing.

### One request record, two interfaces

A service call needs precisely what M5 built for storage: a heap-owned record
that outlives a cancelled awaiter, an orphan list, the two-phase reply for a
variable-sized answer, and the register-then-issue ordering in `await_suspend`.
Writing a second copy of it would have been about 150 lines, a second orphan
list, a second reaper chained off `wake()`, and a second `Request` class in JS.

So `FsRequest`/`FsReq`/`FsCall` moved to `src/kernel/hostcall.h` as
`HostRequest`/`HostReq`/ `HostCall`, tagged with a `HostIface` that picks the
import in `issue()`, and `FsCall` and `SvcCall` are one-line subclasses that
name the op enum. `path_ptr`/`path_len` became `arg_ptr`/`arg_len`, because a
URL and a clipboard string are not paths. `web/abi.js` is the same move:
`Request`, the field table, the error numbering and `statusOf` now live there,
and `fs.js` and `svc.js` both import them.

The risk in a refactor like this is that it quietly breaks the cancellation path
nobody looks at. `test_hostfs` is exactly that test and it did not move, which
is the reason to do the refactor in the same milestone rather than the next one.

The record gained one word, `ref`, and the ownership question that comes with
it. A borrowed slot — `WsSend` naming a socket the caller holds — is just a
number. A slot the *reply* fills is owned by the record, not by the frame:
`reserve_ref()` puts a `JsRef` inside `HostReq`, so a request cancelled before
it is issued frees the slot along with the record, and one cancelled after it is
issued keeps the slot alive at the address the host still holds. `test_svc`
exists for that one case.

### No `host_svc_sync`

The wall clock is the near miss. `Date.now()` is as synchronous as
`performance.now()`, and a `host_clock()` import would have been three lines. It
would also have been §2.2's third exception, and the section says plainly that
at three it stops being pragmatism.

Making it an operation on the asynchronous ABI costs one round trip in a program
that runs once and prints a line. That is the right trade every time, and the
fact that it was even tempting is why the rule is written down.

### Two waits mean two jobs, and the child outlives the parent

`chat` reads the keyboard and the socket at once. `CancelState::waiting` is a
single slot, so that is two jobs — the same conclusion M4 reached for pipeline
stages, and the second place §3.6's structured concurrency is put back by hand
from a destructor.

What is new is that the child can outlive the parent. `run_line`'s `CancelAll`
cancels its stages, but a cancelled coroutine does not unwind until the
scheduler resumes it, which is a tick or two later. In M4 that was harmless: the
pump holds a reference to the refcounted `Job`, so everything it touches is
alive for as long as it is. `chat`'s receiver has no such handle — a program is
given a `Stream`, not the thing that owns the pipe behind it. Cancel `chat` in
`chat url | tee log` and the receiver could wake up to write into a pipe whose
`Job` has already been freed.

So the receiver touches nothing the parent owns: the session is refcounted and
holds the socket, and incoming lines go to `screen_write` — a global, like
`boot.cpp`'s diagnostics. The cost is that `chat > log` does not capture what
arrives. For an interactive program that is close to right anyway, and M7's
layout layer is where a program gets a pane of its own.

This is the second time a child-group awaitable would have made the problem
disappear. It needs intrusive queue links in `Waiter` first, which is the same
work a channel with two blocked senders needs; the note in CLAUDE.md stands,
with one more reason behind it.

### CORS is the first wall, so `curl` says so

A relative URL resolves against the page, which is why `curl /index.html` works
with no network at all and why the acceptance criterion can be met offline.
Anything cross-origin needs the server to send `access-control-allow-origin`,
and `fetch` reports a CORS refusal and a dead network identically, as a
`TypeError` with nothing in it.

That reaches the kernel as `Error::Io`, and "curl: https://…: i/o error" would
send someone looking at their connection. The diagnostic appends "(a
cross-origin URL needs CORS)" on `Io` and nothing else, which is the one hint
that is right most of the time.

### The clipboard, the picker and the download live on the page

Three of the thirteen operations cannot happen in a worker:
`navigator.clipboard` is main-thread only, `<input type="file">` and an
`<a download>` click need the DOM. `web/svc.js` keeps a map of pending ids and
relays those three to the page over `postMessage`.

None of that is visible from the kernel, which is the point of §2.2: a service
operation is a token whether the answer comes from `fetch` in the worker or from
a file picker two threads away. The picker opens inside the transient activation
of the keystroke that ran the command, so `import` needs no button of its own;
the page reads each file with `arrayBuffer()` and posts the bytes down, so the
slot holds a plain array and reading a file back needs no further relay.

### Reading the clipboard needs a gesture the command cannot have

`pbpaste` failed in a browser with "permission denied", and the reason is not a
bug that can be fixed where it appeared. `navigator.clipboard.readText()` is
only permitted from inside a user-gesture handler. Our request reaches the page
over `postMessage`, which is to say after the keystroke's handler has returned —
so the call is *never* inside a gesture, no matter how promptly it arrives.
Safari refuses outright, Firefox does not expose the API to page content, and
Chrome prompts. `pbcopy` is unaffected because `writeText()` is far more
permissive.

Transient activation would not have saved it either: the five-second window
governs things a page *initiates*, and a clipboard read is checked against the
handler it is in.

The escape is that a **paste is the gesture**. The `paste` event delivers the
text with no permission at all, everywhere. So `ClipWait` is a fourteenth
operation: `pbpaste` tries `clip_read()`, and on `Perm` prints "press ⌘V or
ctrl-V to paste" on stderr and parks until the page's `paste` listener answers.
Where `readText()` is allowed, nothing is printed and nothing changes.

Three details fall out of it. `Ctrl+V` joined the reserved set in `web/keys.js`,
since a keystroke the kernel eats produces no `paste` event — on macOS `⌘V` was
already left alone, because `consumes()` never claims a `metaKey` chord. The
held-text buffer in `web/svc.js` exists because the reply is sized twice like
any other, and a paste cannot be asked for again: the same shape as a WebSocket
message waiting at the head of its queue. And `^C` while parked is the ordinary
orphan path — the page's waiter stays armed, the eventual paste replies to a
token nothing waits on, and `host_orphan_reply` reaps the record; the smoke test
walks exactly that.

### A response body streams; a message does not

Two reply shapes, for two different unknowns. A response body is read with
`writeSome` — as much as fits in a 512-byte buffer, with the host keeping the
remainder — because a body has no size worth asking about and 512 bytes is the
allocator's top size class (§8.2). A WebSocket message uses the two-phase reply
instead, because a message is atomic: splitting one across two reads would lose
the boundary that makes it a message.

The retry that the two-phase reply implies is why a `Fetch` reply deposits its
object *before* reporting the header size. A retry arrives with the object
already in the slot, so the host skips the request and only rewrites the headers
— otherwise asking for more room would issue the fetch a second time.

### Proving the browser half without a browser

`test/fakesvc.mjs` mirrors `test/fakefs.mjs`: canned routes, a loopback socket,
a clipboard variable, a fixed set of picked files, all answered from inside the
import. That covers the kernel, and it deliberately does not cover `web/svc.js`,
which is the code a user actually runs.

So `tools/wsd.mjs` is a real WebSocket server — the RFC 6455 handshake and frame
codec in about a hundred lines of dependency-free Node — and `make serve` starts
it beside the static server. Two tabs running `chat ws://localhost:8081` talk to
each other with no internet, which is what the second criterion means and what
the loopback fake cannot show.

### Smaller decisions

- **`/mnt/import` is a directory, not a mount.** The picker hands over bytes. A
  read-through `Fs` over `File` objects would exercise `JsRef` more thoroughly
  and would not make `cat` work any better.
- **`Drop` is fire-and-forget.** Releasing a slot is not enough on its own: an
  open socket is held alive by its own event handlers on the JS side. `JsHandle`
  says so out loud, with a token-less `host_svc` call from its destructor, which
  is also what closes the socket when `^C` destroys the frame holding it.
- **`E` gained `CANCELLED`, `AGAIN` and `CLOSED`.** `web/fs.js` listed only the
  values it reported; a socket that has gone away needs `Closed` to mean EOF to
  a reader, as it does for a pipe.
- **`date` carries its own calendar.** Twenty lines of `civil_from_days` rather
  than asking the host to format, which would have put a locale in the ABI. `-u`
  prints UTC; without it the offset comes back from the host in the reply's
  `flags`, biased by 1440 to stay unsigned.
- **`export` buffers the whole file.** A download is one Blob, so there is
  nothing to stream into.
- **The `help` grid grew.** Twenty-seven programs no longer fit twenty-four
  rows, so `test_prog` and the smoke test both resize before checking `help`.
  That the assertion needed changing at all is the tripwire working.

## M5 — Filesystem

A mount table, four filesystems, an open-file table, redirection that reaches
real files, and seven new commands. This is the first milestone whose state
outlives the tab, which is what makes it the first one where getting the
boundary wrong loses a user's work rather than a frame. 137,867 bytes of
`kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places, because five decisions here differ from
what it said: §3.4's import list, §3.6's `Fs` sketch, §3.7's `externref` table,
§5.1's mount layering and §5.3's capability struct. Each is argued below.

### Two imports, not ten

Storage needs roughly ten operations. Concept.md §3.4 listed `host_storage_read`
and `host_storage_write`, which suggests one named import per operation, and
that is what the naive reading of §2.2 wants: an import is a syscall, so name
it.

The trouble is that the smoke test asserts `kernel.wasm`'s *exact* import list,
deliberately — it is how an accidental libc dependency is caught at link time
rather than as a runtime trap. Ten named imports means that assertion churns on
every operation added, and the churn is noise: nothing about `host_fs_truncate`
appearing is a fact anyone needs to review. What is worth reviewing is a new
*calling convention*, and there are exactly two of those.

So: `host_fs(op, token, req)` for everything asynchronous, and
`host_fs_sync(op, handle, ptr, len, off) -> i32` for §5.2's sanctioned
exception. That is also the shape §4.3 already fixes for the M8 process ABI —
`sys` and `sys_async` — so the boundary userland crosses in M5 is the one it
will keep crossing when programs become instances.

The cost is an untyped op number in place of a symbol, and it is real: a
mismatch between `FsOp` in `src/fs/hostfs.h` and `OP` in `web/fs.js` is a wrong
answer rather than a link error. That is why `test/fakefs.mjs` imports its
constants and its encoders *from* `web/fs.js` rather than restating them — the
two sides of the wire cannot drift without the tests noticing.

### A request outlives its awaiter

`wake(token, ptr, len)` carries two words, and a directory listing is not two
words. Something has to own a buffer the host can write into, and the obvious
answer — export `kalloc`/`kfree` and let JS allocate — is wrong in a way that
took a moment to see.

The problem is cancellation. `^C` during `ls /home` destroys the frame that
issued the request. If the reply buffer lived in that frame, or was owned by the
host on the frame's behalf, the promise resolving a moment later would write
into freed memory. Every awaitable in this system deregisters in its destructor
precisely so that destroying a suspended frame is safe (§8.1), and a raw address
handed across the boundary defeats that.

So a request is a heap record with its own path and reply buffers, and
`FsCall`'s destructor does not free it. If the reply has landed, the record
goes; if it has not, the record is *orphaned* — moved to a list and left alive
at the address the host holds. The reply is what finally reaps it, which is why
`sched_wake` now returns a bool and `wake()` routes an undelivered token to
`fs_orphan_reply`. An unclaimed token was previously ignored; now it is the one
signal that says a record is safe to free.

Two flags decide a record's fate, and both are easy to get wrong. `issued_` says
the host was given the address at all — a request cancelled before it reached
the import has nothing to wait for and must be freed, not orphaned, or it leaks
silently. `done` says the reply landed, and it cannot simply be set on the
resume path: a cancellation also resumes. `sched_cancel` is the only thing that
sets `Waiter::cancelled`, so `done = issued_ && !w_.cancelled` is exactly right,
including the case where a cancellation arrives *after* the reply and the
request is finished with regardless. `test_hostfs` exists for this and nothing
else.

This also keeps the export surface where §3.4 put it: `init`, `wake`, `tick`,
`key`, `resize` and `memory` is what M5 ships, exactly as M2 did.

### Naming is asynchronous; an open file is not

Concept.md §3.6's `Fs` was `read`/`write`/`list`, all returning `Task`.
Splitting it instead by *when the work can happen* is the single change that
makes the rest of the milestone simple.

`stat`, `list`, `open`, `mkdir` and `remove` may need the host, so they park.
`read`, `write`, `size`, `truncate` and `close` act on an open handle, and §5.2
says those are genuinely synchronous on OPFS. Following that split gives
redirection its shape for free: a job opens its files at setup, before any stage
is spawned, and from then on `Stream::Write` is a plain call. The file-backed
`Stream` and `Source` never park, so their `park` hook is null and the whole
retry-on-`Again` path is dead code for them.

It also means a failed open stops the command before it produces side effects,
which is what a shell does and what M4's placeholder refusal was standing in
for.

`read` fills a caller's buffer rather than returning `Bytes`. That is the same
argument the pipe made in M4: a `Span` is a pointer and a length, and nothing
below the VFS owns a buffer the caller may keep.

### /bin is a filesystem

M4's `ls` listed the program registry and its comment promised that M5 would
replace the body with a walk of the mount table. Doing only that would have left
`/bin` an empty directory — programs are in-kernel coroutines until M8 — and the
registry reachable only through `help`.

`BinFs` is about sixty lines and fixes both: the registry *is* a read-only
filesystem mounted on `/bin`, `ls` really is an ordinary directory walk, and
`ls /bin | grep hel` still means what it meant in M4. A file there reads as the
program's usage line, because that is the only thing about a program there is to
read. When M8 gives programs binaries, the mount changes and nothing above it
does.

It lives in `src/user/` rather than `src/fs/` because the registry does, and
`braam_fs` must not depend upwards.

### The bundle is an archive, not the Cache API

§5.1 pairs `BundleFs` with the Cache API. The Cache API stores
`Request`/`Response` pairs, which is a good fit *once something is producing
them* — and that is `fetch`, which is M6. Using it now would mean pulling M6's
import forward to serve a tree that never changes after the build.

Instead the worker loads one `bundle.bin` beside `kernel.wasm` and hands the
bytes over through the `Bundle` operation, and `BundleFs` unpacks it in memory.
One request instead of one per file, no new import, and the format is small
enough that `tools/pack.py` and `src/fs/bundlefs.cpp` are each about eighty
lines. The smoke test is given the archive the build just produced, so the
packer and the reader are checked against each other rather than each against
its own reading of the format.

*Superseded.* The archive is unpacked into the store rather than mounted from
memory, so the kernel does not read it at all and the hand-rolled format bought
nothing — it is `rootfs.zip` now, and only `web/fs.js` parses it. See "One
store, and rootfs.zip". The last sentence still holds: the smoke test is still
given the archive the build just produced.

### Two round trips, not one enormous buffer

A reply whose size is not known in advance — a listing, the bundle — is asked
for twice: the first attempt reports the room it needs and writes nothing, and
the kernel retries with a buffer that size. The alternative is a buffer big
enough for anything, and the allocator makes that expensive in a specific way:
512 bytes is the top size class and a byte more costs a whole 64 KiB span
(§8.2). A directory that fits in a block — nearly all of them — costs one trip;
one that does not costs two, and only pays for a span when it genuinely needs
one.

That is also why files are read `FS_BLOCK` = 512 bytes at a time, and why
`file_read` stages through a stack buffer rather than a `String`: reading is
synchronous, so the buffer does not have to survive a suspension, and a 512-byte
chunk lands exactly in the top size class on its way into a pipe.

### One open handle per file

§5.2 said the open-file table should refuse a second *writer*. It refuses a
second open of any kind, because that is what OPFS actually enforces:
`createSyncAccessHandle()` takes an exclusive lock and a second handle fails
whatever mode it asks for.

The looser rule would have worked on `MemFs` and failed on OPFS, which is the
worst outcome — a program that behaves differently depending on which mount its
path landed in. `cat a a` is refused as a result. That is a real restriction and
an odd command, and the honest rule is worth more than the odd command.

### The working directory is a global

A program is `Task<i32>(Args, Stdio)`. There is nowhere to put a per-process cwd
until §4.3's ABI gives a process a context, which is M8. With one shell running,
a global and a per-process cwd are indistinguishable, so `cd` mutates one
`String` in the VFS and the difference is deferred rather than designed around.

The shell starts in `/home` rather than `/`, which is what makes
`echo hi > notes` land somewhere that survives a reload without the user having
to know that it must. The prompt stays `$`: putting the cwd in it is layout
work, and it belongs with M7 rather than with a change that would churn every
screen assertion in the tests.

### Boot happens in the shell, before the first prompt

Mounting needs to `co_await`, and `init()` is not a coroutine. Spawning a
mounter alongside the shell would race the first prompt against the mount table.
Awaiting it in `shell()` before the prompt is the only ordering that is correct,
and it is also where the "no OPFS" line belongs — the third acceptance criterion
is a sentence printed above the first prompt.

*Superseded in part.* The ordering is unchanged and the reason for it stands,
but the line above the first prompt is now a refusal rather than a warning, and
there is no prompt after it. See "One store, and rootfs.zip".

The work is in `boot_filesystem()` rather than inline so that its locals stay
out of the shell's frame, which has a size class to fit inside; `test_shell`
guards that at 1 KiB and the guard is why the split exists. It is idempotent,
because a test boots the shell a dozen times against one mount table and every
one of those must not report the mounts as errors.

### Proving the reload without a browser

"Write a file, reload the page, the file is still there" reads like a criterion
only a browser can check. It is not: what a reload destroys is the
`WebAssembly.Instance`, and what it preserves is the store behind OPFS.
`test/fakefs.mjs` puts the store in module scope, so the smoke test writes a
file, throws the instance away, instantiates the same module again, and reads it
back — with a real browser check still required before the milestone is
believed, but with the mechanism itself under CI.

The fake answers from inside the import, which no browser can do. The kernel
cannot tell: `wake()` only queues a resumption, and the tick that issued the
request drains the queue on its way out. One case in the smoke test holds
replies back anyway and delivers them by hand, so the genuinely-parked path is
covered too rather than assumed.

### Smaller decisions

- **`Error::NotEmpty` is new.** `rm` on a populated directory needed a message
  of its own, and overloading `Invalid` would have printed "invalid" for the one
  error a user hits by accident.
- **`heap_new`/`heap_delete` are new.** `operator new` returns null on failure
  and `-fno-exceptions` means a plain `new` would then construct at address
  zero. Every allocation in `src/fs/` goes through the checked pair instead;
  `job.cpp`'s hand-rolled version is now one of them.
- **`vfs_list` folds in mount points.** A mount point need not exist in the
  filesystem beneath it, so `ls /` would not have shown `/home` at all. The
  table supplies the entry.
- **Listings are sorted in the VFS, not in `ls`.** Insertion sort over a
  directory, which needs no scratch and is small enough not to matter — and it
  means every consumer sees a stable order, not just the one that remembered to
  sort.
- **`persisted` is posted down from the page.** `navigator.storage.persist()` is
  not available in a worker (§A.2), and boot waits for the answer rather than
  guessing: `df` reporting the wrong durability is worse than a tick of delay.
- **`close` flushes.** A sync access handle buffers, and flushing on every write
  would give up the reason for using one. Closing is the point at which we know
  it is safe.

## M4 — Streams

Pipes with real backpressure, stdin, the whole shell grammar, and a `^C` that
reaches a running pipeline. This is the milestone where three debts recorded
below come due at once — `send()`'s policy, the owning token store quoting
forces, and a shell that can watch the keyboard while a child runs — and where
the first thing in the system runs genuinely concurrently with another. 62,926
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

Nothing here changed a design *decision*, so `Concept.md` is not amended. Two
comments that described plans rather than facts are: `tty.h`'s, which proposed
putting the screen behind a byte channel, and `shell.cpp`'s, which named an
argv-lifetime invariant that no longer exists.

### A pipe carries owning chunks, not `Bytes`

M4's objective says `Channel<Bytes>` and `Bytes` already exists —
`using Bytes = Span<const u8>` — so the obvious reading is that a pipe moves
`Bytes`. It cannot. A `Span` is a pointer and a length, and the whole point of a
pipe is that the reader runs *later*: by the time it takes the value, the
writer's buffer is a dead coroutine frame. The channel has to own what it
carries, so a pipe is `Channel<String, 8>` and `Stream::Write` copies into a
`String` on the way in.

The copy is the price of the decoupling and it is the same copy `Bytes` would
have needed somewhere else, in a place with less obvious ownership. `String`
also happens to satisfy exactly what the ring needs — a default constructor for
the inline slots and move-assignment for `try_send` — which is not a
coincidence: `Vec<String>` was already proven by the editor's history.

Capacity is counted in *chunks*, not bytes, so one huge write occupies one slot
and backpressure is per-write. Eight slots is enough to keep a producer and a
consumer both busy without making the block that holds them large; the number is
one constant in `io.h`.

### What `send()` decided

M2 deferred blocking send because the decisions belonged to pipes. Here they
are.

**A cancelled sender delivers nothing.** The value lives in the awaitable and
dies with it; the ring is only ever written by `put()`, which a cancelled sender
never reaches. That is the only answer that keeps cancellation meaning "unwinds
by returning", because a half-delivered value would have to be either dropped
silently or delivered by a task that has already been killed.

**A full channel parks.** Not an error, not a drop — parking *is* backpressure,
and a pipe that dropped would make `ls | wc` report a number that depends on
scheduling. The one place that deliberately drops instead is the tty pump, for
the reason M2 gives about the keyboard ring.

**Closing is directional, because a pipe is.** `close()` is the writer saying
there is no more: the receiver drains what is queued and only *then* reads
`Err(Closed)`, so nothing in flight is lost. `hangup()` is the reader saying it
will take no more: parked and future senders get `Err(Closed)`. Two verbs rather
than one, because "the far end is gone" means opposite things at the two ends,
and a single `close()` would have had to guess which.

`Error::Closed` is a new value rather than a reuse of `Again`. `Again` is
already the stray-wake sentinel — "you were woken but there is nothing here" —
and end of input is the opposite claim. Overloading it would have made a
spurious `wake()` from JS indistinguishable from EOF.

### `take()` wakes the sender, not `await_resume`

The obvious symmetry to `try_send` waking a parked receiver is
`Recv::await_resume` waking a parked sender, and it deadlocks.
`Recv::await_ready` is `!empty()`, so a receiver that finds the ring non-empty
never suspends and is never resumed by a wake — and that is the *ordinary* case
for a pipe, where the reader is usually behind. The wake has to live in
`take()`, which is the one thing every path that removes a value goes through.

The same reasoning put the closed check into `await_ready`: a receiver parked on
an empty pipe has nothing coming to wake it when the writer closes, so `close()`
has to wake it explicitly and `await_ready` has to admit that a closed empty
channel is ready.

### The intrusive waiter queue is still not needed, and now says so

M2's notes hand this milestone the job of putting intrusive queue links inside
`Waiter`, so that deregistration lives in one place, "when `send()` needs it
too". It does not need it. Every channel in the system has exactly one writer —
each pipe has one upstream stage, `err` is the console, the input pipe has only
the pump, and the report channel uses `try_send` — so a single `send_token_`,
symmetric with the existing `recv_token_`, holds every case, and the existing
cancellation path works untouched.

That is true of *this* grammar. `2>&1` would join two writers onto one channel
and silently clobber a token, which is the kind of bug that shows up as a lost
wakeup three milestones later. So `Send::await_suspend` and `park_sender` panic
if a second sender arrives, and the operator that would trip it arrives with the
queue work rather than before it.

### The pipeline is a heap block, and could not be anything else

The natural shape is locals in the shell's frame: the parsed pipeline, the
pipes, the report channel. Two things forbid it, and both are load-bearing
enough that `test_shell` guards them.

The allocator's top size class is 512 bytes and anything above it takes a whole
64 KiB span, so a shell frame carrying a pipeline would cost a span *per shell*.
And `~Sched` destroys jobs in spawn order — the shell first — so a stage frame
pointing into the shell's frame is a use-after-free during `sched_reset`, which
the test suite does after every case.

One object answers both: a refcounted heap block holding the frozen pipeline,
the pipes, the report channel and the pid list. The shell holds a reference,
each stage holds one through an RAII local in its own frame, and the last one
out frees it — so the order they leave in stops mattering. `~Sched` also now
runs backwards, since a child is spawned after its parent, and `sched_cancel`
stands down while it does, because `jobs` holds freed pointers as that loop
walks.

The pipes inside it are individually heap-allocated rather than an array, for a
smaller reason with the same shape: `Channel` deletes its copy constructor,
which suppresses the implicit move, so `Vec<Channel>` does not compile — and an
inline array of eight would have pushed the block past 512 anyway.

### A tty pump, not a `select`

M3's notes name the two candidates for interrupting a running program: a second
receiver on a single-receiver channel, or a `select`-shaped combinator. Neither
is what landed, because both fight the same constraint from opposite sides —
`CancelState::waiting` is a single slot, so one task tree can be parked on
exactly one awaiter, and a select over two channels needs two.

Instead the keyboard changes hands. While a pipeline runs, a spawned pump
coroutine is the only receiver on `keys()` and the shell is parked on the job's
report channel; when the job ends the pump is cancelled and the shell takes the
keyboard back. The one-receiver rule holds at every instant, and it holds
*structurally* rather than by luck: `sched_unwait` knows nothing about channels,
so a cancelled pump leaves its token in `keys()` until its `~Recv` runs, and the
shell must not re-register before then. That is why the pump files a report of
its own and the shell waits for it — the report is proof the pump has unwound.
The equality guard in `~Recv` is now load-bearing for two receivers rather than
one, and is commented as such.

The pump never parks on the input pipe, and that is not an optimisation.
`ls | grep foo` reads no stdin, so a blocking pump would fill the eight-slot
ring after eight keystrokes, park, stop being the receiver on `keys()` — and
make `^C` unreachable, defeating the milestone's own criterion within a second
of key autorepeat. It drops instead, which is the policy `key()` already uses on
the keyboard ring and for the same reason: there is nowhere to report a full
ring to.

This also means the shell has exactly one path. A single command is a one-stage
pipeline with a pump, costing two extra job records and two frames, because the
`^C` criterion is met by `sleep 5000` and a fast path for single commands would
have left precisely that case broken.

### Structured concurrency, put back by hand

§3.6 says a parent `co_await`s a child group and cancellation propagates down
the tree. The stages here are independent scheduler jobs with independent
`CancelState`s, so it does not. That is forced rather than chosen: the stages of
a pipeline must all be parked at once, one job cannot have two children parked
at once, and `sched_spawn` is the only concurrency there is.

What §3.6 buys is put back explicitly. A destructor in `run_line`'s frame
cancels every launched stage and the pump — a destructor rather than a branch,
because a cancelled coroutine cannot park again to clean up (every
`await_suspend` here declines to suspend once the flag is set) and because the
frame may be destroyed outright rather than resumed. The same reasoning shapes a
stage's epilogue: closing its output, hanging up its input and filing its report
all happen in a destructor, so they also happen when the stage is cancelled or
destroyed while suspended.

That epilogue is the whole of the early-close mechanism. `head -n 1` needs no
way to say "I am done" — it returns, its runner hangs up its input, and the next
write upstream gets `Err(Closed)`.

A real child-group awaitable is what would retire this, and it needs the
intrusive `Waiter` links above. The two deferrals are the same deferral.

### A frame that will not allocate is now a value

`operator new` returns null and its comment says callers must check, but no
promise declared `get_return_object_on_allocation_failure`, so the compiler was
entitled to assume it never does. `sched_spawn`'s `if (!t) return 0` was written
in anticipation of this and could not fire.

M4 is where it matters, because "how many stages actually launched" is a number
the shell has to wait for exactly. So `TaskPromise` declares the handler, which
also switches frame allocation to the nothrow `operator new` the standard names
for it — hence a `std::nothrow_t` in `types.h`, which is a declaration the
freestanding build has to supply like everything else. Awaiting a task whose
frame never allocated panics rather than reading a promise that does not exist;
only a spawned root turns the failure into a value, which is the only place that
can do anything with it.

### The terminal stays a cell grid

`tty.h` said M4 would replace the console sink with a pair of `Channel<Bytes>`
and move the screen behind a reader task. It does not, and the comment is
amended instead. §2.3 is the stronger argument: the terminal *is* a cell grid,
and a byte channel in front of it would add a copy, a frame and a scheduling hop
to reach an array `screen_write` already fills synchronously — while putting
terminal output behind a bounded queue that can drop. The one thing the reader
task would have bought, `prog | prog` and `prog | screen` sharing one mechanism,
the `Stream` function pointer gives for nothing.

`Stream` did have to grow. A sink can now answer `Err(Again)` for "full, park
me" and gets a second function pointer to arm the wake token with; `Write`
gained a `Waiter` and, more importantly, a destructor that deregisters it,
without which a frame destroyed mid-write leaves a dangling pointer in the wake
table — exactly the bug the channel notes below describe. `Write` retries once
after being woken, which is enough because a pipe has one writer and being woken
by `take()` means there is room; a second `Again` is a stray wake, and
`write_all` loops for the programs that care. `Stream::write` stayed an
awaitable rather than becoming a `Task` for the reason M3 gives: a coroutine
frame per write is the hot path §8.2 warns about.

`Source` is its mirror, and `Stdio` gained an `in`. A program the shell gave no
input gets a source that reports EOF immediately rather than a null one, so no
program has to check.

### The store that replaced the borrow

M3's notes predicted this exactly: quote removal produces words that are not
substrings of the line, which destroys the zero-copy argv path and forces an
owning token store the parser is built around. Both halves happened.

Words are appended to one growing `String` and turned into `Str` only by
`freeze()`, because the store reallocates while it grows and every view into it
would move. Making that a rule enforced by the API rather than by a comment
matters more than it looks: `add_word` panics after `freeze`, and the accessors
panic before it, so the one ordering that must hold cannot be got wrong quietly.
Moving a *frozen* pipeline is still safe — `String` and `Vec` move by stealing
the pointer, so nothing shifts — and that is what lets the parse result live in
the job block rather than in a frame. It would not be true of a
small-string-optimised string, which is worth knowing before anyone adds one.

`Args` stays a non-owning `Span<const Str>`, now over the store rather than over
the shell's line buffer. The invariant M3's comment called "the single easiest
thing for M4's pipelines to break" is not preserved so much as retired: nothing
borrows from `line.text` any more.

Redirection targets live in a second table rather than among the words, so that
a command's argv stays contiguous. `> f ls` would otherwise put `f` in `ls`'s
argv.

### Redirection is parsed and refused

Quoting, escaping, `|` and `>` are one grammar and writing half of it means
writing it twice, so all of it is written. There is no filesystem to redirect
*to* until M5, so a path target is refused — but at pipeline setup, before
anything is spawned, rather than at the first write. A sink that fails on its
first write would let a command run and produce its side effects before its
redirection turned out to be impossible, which is not what a shell does. When M5
lands, one function turns the refusal into an open.

`out` and `err` are still the same sink, for the reason M3 gave: `2>` is parsed,
so the split is now expressible, but there is nowhere for it to go.

### `ls` lists the registry

The criterion is `ls | grep foo`, and `ls` lists a filesystem that arrives a
milestone later. Rather than reword the criterion or pull `MemFs` forward, `ls`
lists the program registry — which is what `/bin` will hold, and which §4's tier
table already calls a kernel applet's job. The criterion is met literally, the
pipeline it exists to prove is proved, and M5 replaces a loop over
`program_first()` with a walk of the mount table while the test stays green.

### Smaller decisions

`clear` still writes to the grid rather than to `io.out`. Clearing is a grid
operation with no byte representation, so `clear > f` is meaningless; the honest
cost is that `clear | cat` clears the screen, which is what it says it does.

`grep` is a substring match, and its usage line says "text" rather than implying
a pattern language. `cat` copies chunks rather than lines, so it is byte-exact
and a final line without a newline stays that way; `grep`, `head`, `tail` and
the rest go through a `LineReader` that keeps a partial chunk, so a line may
span any number of chunks. `wc` counts over raw chunks for the same reason —
nothing should depend on where a chunk happens to break.

`LineEnd::Eof` is still not there. ^D closes a program's stdin through the pump,
which is where end of input actually means something; at the prompt there is
nowhere to exit to, and inventing a meaning for it before there is one is how
enums acquire dead members.

The size more than doubled, 28,282 to 62,926 bytes, which is 24% of the budget
M3 raised with exactly this in mind. Six new programs, a lexer, a parser, the
job runtime and a second awaitable pair account for it; the budget is not moved.

---

## M3 — Userland shell

The `LineEditor` coroutine §3.5 promised, a tokeniser, the self-registering
program registry of §3.6, argv and exit codes — and the first build where the
thing on screen is an operating environment rather than a demonstration. 28,282
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against a budget raised from 32 KiB to 256 KiB in this
milestone.

### Static initialisers now run, and one invariant is retired

M0 left a question open — "self-registration needs `__wasm_call_ctors`, which
`--no-entry` leaves uncalled, and that question is better settled in M3 where
the program registry actually depends on it" — and this is where it is settled.
`init()` calls `__wasm_call_ctors()` itself.

The alternative was a linker-section table: a `constexpr` descriptor per program
placed in a custom data section with `__attribute__((section, used, retain))`,
walked between the linker-defined `__start_`/`__stop_` symbols. It needs no
constructors at all, so it would have kept the invariant intact. It was not
chosen because §3.6 says "populated at static-init time by an inline registrar"
and there was no reason to route around the spec; because the section trick is a
second, undocumented dependency on linker behaviour on top of the ones Appendix
C already records; and because static init is a capability the whole system
wants once, not a trick one subsystem uses.

`__wasm_call_ctors` is synthesised by wasm-ld with hidden visibility, so a plain
`extern "C"` declaration reaches it and **no export is added** — the
exact-surface assertion in `run.mjs` is the guard on that claim, and it would
have fired on the first build if the assumption were wrong. The call sits
*after* `heap_init`, so a constructor added later may allocate; that ordering is
the new invariant and it is commented at the call site.

What does not change is the destructor half. `__cxa_atexit` is still unprovided,
deliberately, so a namespace-scope global with a non-trivial destructor is still
a link error. `Heap`, `Screen`, `Channel` and the registry's list head remain
PODs; `Sched` remains behind a pointer. CLAUDE.md's statement of the rule has
been amended, because its first clause — that `--no-entry` never calls
`__wasm_call_ctors` — is now false of this kernel.

`tests.wasm` calls it too, so the cases see the registry the shipping kernel
sees. Its own case list stays explicit in `main.cpp`: the order is load-bearing
where cases share global state, and converting it would be an unrelated refactor
riding along in this milestone.

### A sorted intrusive list, not a `HashMap`

M1's notes anticipated the registry wanting `HashMap`'s FNV-1a overload for
`Str` keys. It does not. `help` has to *enumerate* the registry and `HashMap`
has no iteration API; `HashMap::insert` allocates, and a static-init registrar
must not touch the heap before anyone has reasoned about whether it exists; and
with seven programs a linear scan of `Str` compares is not measurable against
the coroutine frame the lookup is about to allocate anyway.

Insertion is sorted rather than push-front, which costs nothing at seven entries
and buys something specific: the order of static initialisation across
translation units is unspecified, so a push-front list would make `help`'s
output depend on the link order, and therefore make it untestable. Sorted,
`help` needs no sort of its own and the smoke test can assert the listing.

### `src/prog/` is an OBJECT library, and that is not a detail

Nothing in the system references `src/prog/echo.cpp` by name. Those translation
units reach the link only through their registrars, and `--gc-sections` never
extracts an archive member that no symbol references — the same trap
`CMakeLists.txt` already documents for `main.cpp`. As a `STATIC` library,
`src/prog/` would link cleanly and produce a kernel with an empty registry: no
warning, no error, a shell where every command is "not found". CMake puts an
OBJECT library's objects directly on the consuming link line, which is exactly
the property required.

Because that failure is silent, `test_prog` asserts the exact *count* of
registered programs and their order, not that a few known names are present. A
spot check would survive losing the programs it does not name.

### The exit code goes in the prompt

"A nonzero exit code is observable" has two obvious readings: a diagnostic line
after every failure, or a status indicator in the prompt. The prompt wins on
four counts. It is one screen read for the smoke test — `false` followed by a
row reading `[1] $` proves the criterion in a single assertion, and `nosuch`
followed by `[127] $` proves the not-found path in the same shape. It invents no
stream semantics before M4 defines them: a diagnostic line for every nonzero
status would be the shell writing to a stderr that does not yet mean anything,
and no real shell does it. It costs nothing in the common case. And it composes
forward, since a pipeline's status is its last command's and nothing about the
prompt changes.

The shell reads that status by `co_await`ing the program's `Task<i32>` rather
than spawning it. That is not a style choice: `sched_tick` reaps a finished job
and destroys it, so the promise's `i32` is unreachable after the fact, and
awaiting is the only way to see it at all. Awaiting is also what propagates the
`CancelState` into the program, and what makes the single-receiver rule on the
keyboard hold — while a program runs the shell is suspended inside `co_await`,
not on `keys()`, so nothing can displace anything. Keys typed during a program
stay in the ring as typeahead.

### `Vec<char32_t>` for the line, and a redraw that infers its own scrolling

The line buffer is one codepoint per element, not UTF-8. In M3 one codepoint is
one cell, so every editing operation and all of the redraw's column arithmetic
is plain indexing; with a `String`, Left, Right, Backspace, kill-word and the
wrap calculation would each need a codepoint scan, and mid-line insertion would
need a byte shuffle regardless. The cost is four bytes per character against a
span allocator, which is noise, and the single UTF-8 encode happens once, at
Return. The payoff is that `String::insert`/`erase` never had to be written;
`Vec::insert`/`erase` did, and they are useful to everything else.

The screen has no erase-to-end-of-line, no insert-character and no scroll
counter, so the editor repaints the whole line from an anchor on every keystroke
and blanks the tail by hand, tracking how many cells the previous paint covered.
The interesting part is keeping the anchor correct when a paint scrolls the
grid: nothing reports a scroll, so the editor computes where the write *should*
have ended — `y0 + (x0 + n - 1) / cols`, using the deferred wrap — and takes the
shortfall against the actual `cursor_y` as the number of rows the grid moved.
That is exact, because `screen_newline` is the only thing besides our own writes
that can move the cursor.

Two consequences worth stating. `screen_move` clamps to `cols - 1`, so the
deferred-wrap column is unreachable by cursor addressing; the editor places a
cursor at an exact multiple of `cols` at column 0 of the *next* row, which is
not a compromise — after `wrap_pending` that is genuinely where the next
character lands. And a line longer than the whole grid pushes its own prompt off
the top, after which the anchor clamps at row 0 and the leftmost cells are
wrong. Fixing that needs a line model the grid does not have, which is the M7
layout layer's; M3 accepts the cosmetic glitch and tests the case that matters,
where the anchor follows a scroll correctly.

An unconditional repaint is more work than the common case needs — appending at
the end with no wrap is one `screen_put`. It is a few hundred cell writes
coalesced into one damage rectangle and one `host_present` per tick, which is
nothing at keyboard rates, and the optimisation can be added later against a
test suite that already pins the behaviour down.

### `Stream::Write` does its work in `await_suspend`

§3.6 fixes the program signature as `Task<int>(Args, Stdio)`, and M4 will put a
`Channel<Bytes>` behind `Stdio` where a write to a full pipe has to park.
Writing `io.out.write(s)` as a plain call now would mean rewriting every call
site in `src/prog/` then; writing it as `co_await io.out.write(s)` from the
start costs a suspend point that is never taken.

The work happens in `await_suspend`, which returns `false` to resume
immediately, rather than in an `await_ready` that returns `true`. Only
`await_suspend` receives the coroutine handle, and therefore the promise, and
therefore the `CancelState` — an awaitable that completes in `await_ready` would
be the one thing in the system that cannot see cancellation, which §8.1 exists
to forbid. A never-taken suspend point in exchange for the rule holding
everywhere is a good trade.

`Stream` is a function pointer plus a `void *`, not a virtual interface. There
will be exactly two implementations, and a vtable costs a data section and an
indirect-call table entry per implementation for no gain. `out` and `err` are
the same sink in M3, because the split is meaningless until there is redirection
to tell them apart.

### The tokeniser has no quoting, on purpose

Quote *removal* produces tokens that are not substrings of the input, which
destroys the zero-copy property the whole argv path depends on — `Args` is a
`Span<const Str>` over views into the shell's line buffer, and nothing copies.
Supporting quotes would force an owning token store that M4's parser would then
have to be built around. And quoting, escaping, `|` and `>` are one grammar:
writing half of it now means writing it twice. The visible consequence is that
`echo 'a b'` prints the quotes, which is stated in `echo`'s usage line rather
than hidden.

The lifetime that makes this work — `argv` borrowing from `line.text`, which is
a named local in the shell's frame and stays alive across the `co_await` of the
program — is commented in `shell.cpp`, because it is the single easiest thing
for M4's pipelines to break.

### What ^C does, and what it does not do yet

Typed at the prompt, ^C writes `^C`, abandons the buffer and returns
`LineEnd::Interrupt`; the shell prints a fresh prompt carrying 130. Typed while
a program runs, it sits in the keyboard ring and is consumed as typeahead by the
next `read_line`.

Interrupting a *running* program is M4's criterion and stays there. It needs the
shell to watch the keyboard while a child runs — a second receiver on a
single-receiver channel, or a `select`-shaped combinator — and both are streams
work. What M3 owes is that the mechanism underneath is already in place, which
is what the cancellation cases in `test_edit` and `test_shell` assert:
`sched_cancel` on the shell unwinds through `co_await`ing a program, through a
running `sleep`, and out of a `Recv` parked on the keyboard, with the channel
left usable.

`LineEnd` is a named enum rather than a bool for the same reason: M4 and M7 will
add `Eof` and whatever a job-control shell needs, and the signature should not
change when they do.

### Smaller decisions

`sleep` takes **milliseconds**. There is no float parser, the scheduler is a
millisecond machine, and the smoke test needs an exact number to assert
`tick()`'s return value against. The divergence from POSIX lives in the usage
string.

`read_line` is `Task<Result<Line>>` on the `LineEditor`, where §3.3 sketches
`Task<Line> read_line(Tty&)`. §3.3's sketch already diverges from shipped
signatures — it lists `Task<void> sleep_ms(u32)` where the kernel has
`Task<Result<void>>` — so it is read as illustrative, and `Concept.md` is not
amended. Nothing in M3 changed a design *decision*, which is the bar for
touching the spec.

`utf8_decode` moved out of `screen.cpp` into `src/kernel/text.h`, because the
editor needs to decode history entries and two decoders in one system is one too
many. The behaviour changed in one untested corner: a stray continuation byte
now yields U+FFFD and draws, where it used to be skipped silently. Visible
corruption beats invisible corruption.

Ctrl-W is bound to kill-word and unit-tested, but `web/keys.js` deliberately
leaves Ctrl+W to the browser, which closes the tab — a page that swallows it is
a page you cannot leave. So Alt-Backspace is bound to the same action and is the
one that actually reaches a browser. That is a keybinding decision, not a change
to what `keys.js` forwards.

### The budget moved

M0 set 32 KiB and M1 and M2 stayed well inside it. M3 does not: the shell, the
editor and seven programs took `kernel.wasm` from 14,011 to 28,282 bytes, about
86% of the old ceiling, with M4's streams and M5's filesystem still to come. The
budget is now 256 KiB. That is a deliberate act, as the file's own comment
requires, and the reasoning is that 32 KiB was a nucleus-sized number chosen
when the nucleus was all there was; a self-contained operating environment with
a filesystem and a program set is not a 32 KiB artifact, and a ceiling that has
to be raised every milestone measures nothing. 256 KiB is still small enough
that a regression of the kind the check exists to catch — a libc dependency, an
accidental template explosion — moves it visibly.

Roughly 4.4 KiB of the 28 KiB is the wasm `name` section. It is kept:
`--strip-all` would remove it, and with it every symbol name in a browser stack
trace.

---

## M2 — Screen and keys

The cell grid, its damage rectangle and the canvas renderer, `Channel<T>`, and
the `key` and `resize` exports that complete §3.4's five — §2.3 and §3.5 made
real, plus the first code in the system that a user can see. 14,011 bytes of
`kernel.wasm`, against the same 32 KiB budget.

### `resize` returns where the screen is

§3.4 lists `resize(cols, rows)` with no return value, but the renderer has to
learn three things from somewhere: the address of the cell array, the geometry,
and where the cursor is. Four mechanisms could carry them. A hard-coded address
reverses M0's deliberate decision that the host stays ignorant of the kernel's
memory map. Exporting a wasm global needs a linker flag, and exports are named
with `BRAAM_EXPORT` or not at all. Widening `host_present` re-sends unchanging
geometry on every frame and only tells the host anything *after* the first
paint. A separate `screen()` export is the honest alternative and was close, but
`resize` is already the one call that reallocates the grid, so it is already the
moment every cached view has to be re-derived (§8.4) — making it also the moment
the address is handed over keeps that discipline in one place instead of two,
and keeps the export list at the five §3.4 names.

So `resize` returns the address of a static `Screen` descriptor, or 0 if the new
grid could not be allocated. Static, not heap, so the address is a link-time
constant the host can hold forever; and it carries a `'BSCR'` magic word, so a
renderer paired with the wrong build says so rather than drawing noise. §3.4 is
amended.

Failure is all-or-nothing: the replacement grid is allocated and filled before
anything is published, so a `resize` that returns 0 leaves the old screen whole
and still on display. And the geometry is clamped — 512 columns by 256 rows —
because `cols * rows * sizeof(Cell)` is computed in a 32-bit `usize`, and a host
that asked for 30000×20000 would otherwise wrap it to a small allocation and
then write past the end. The host reads `cols` and `rows` back out of the
descriptor instead of assuming it got what it asked for, which makes clamping,
out-of-memory and success one path on the JS side: *draw what the descriptor
says*.

### One rectangle, flushed once a tick, with the cursor folded in

Damage could be presented per write, which would mean an import call per
character. It is instead accumulated into a single rectangle and flushed from
`tick()` after `sched_tick()` returns, so a tick that typed a line presents once
and an idle tick presents not at all. `tick()` in `main.cpp` does the flushing
rather than the scheduler, so the screen does not become a dependency of the
scheduler.

The cursor is drawn by the renderer and stored nowhere, which means moving it
dirties two cells: the one it left and the one it entered. Marking both at every
site that moves the cursor works until someone adds a site and forgets — and
M3's line editor will add several. So `screen_flush` remembers where the cursor
was last drawn and folds the move into the rectangle itself. Mutations now only
have to mark cells they actually wrote, and the ghost-cursor bug is unavailable
by construction.

### Channel wakeups reuse the token table

A receiver suspended on an empty channel has to be resumed by whichever
`try_send` fills it. The obvious mechanism is a new scheduler entry point taking
the `Waiter *` the channel holds — and it is a trap. `sched_cancel` unwaits and
readies a waiter, but `sched_unwait` knows only about the timer queue and the
wake table; it cannot unlink from a channel it has never heard of. A cancelled
receiver would therefore sit on the ready queue while still listed in the
channel, and the next `try_send` would queue the same handle a second time.
Fixing that properly means intrusive queue links inside `Waiter` so that
deregistration stays in one place, which is real machinery and, on the evidence,
M4's to build when `send()` needs it too.

The channel instead allocates a wake token and stores only the token, not the
pointer. `sched_wake` on a token nothing waits on is already defined to be
ignored — "a late or cancelled event" — so a stale token after a cancellation is
ordinary traffic rather than a use-after-free, and every existing path works
untouched: `sched_unwait` in the awaiter's destructor deregisters,
`sched_cancel` already knows how to pull a token waiter out. Nothing in
`sched.h` or `sched.cpp` changed for M2.

The cost is a hash insert and remove per suspension, which is nothing at
keyboard rates and worth revisiting in M4 when `Channel<Bytes>` carries pipe
traffic. The price of a globally visible token is that a stray `wake()` from JS
can resume a receiver spuriously, so `await_resume` checks the ring rather than
trusting the wake and returns `Error::Again` when there is nothing to take.
Without that check the count would underflow.

### `Channel<T>` gets its mechanism, M4 gets its policy

§3.6 specifies both `co_await ch.recv()` and `co_await ch.send(v)`. Only `recv`
and a non-blocking `try_send` landed. The size argument for deferring would be
bogus — an uninstantiated member of a class template emits nothing — but
blocking send needs decisions M2 has no way to make: what a cancelled sender
does with its half-delivered value, whether a full channel with no receiver
parks or errors, and what closing one does to the senders waiting on it. Those
are pipe semantics, and M4 defines them. An awaiter nothing awaits is an awaiter
nothing tests, and the test suite is the thing that has found every real bug so
far.

The ring is inline rather than heap-allocated, which is what lets the keyboard
channel be a plain global. A `--no-entry` binary never runs `__wasm_call_ctors`,
so a global has to be correct when zero-initialised and trivially destructible —
the same constraint that pushed the scheduler behind a pointer in M1, solved the
other way here because a fixed-capacity ring has no allocation to do. Sending
therefore cannot fail for want of memory, which matters because `key()` is
called from the host with nowhere to report an error to. A full ring drops the
newest event, which is the right failure for a keyboard.

### Keys are codepoints; there are no control characters

`key(code, mods)` carries a Unicode codepoint for anything printable and a value
above `0x110000` for the named keys, so the two can never collide. Enter, Tab
and Backspace are named keys, not `0x0D`, `0x09` and `0x08` — the temptation to
encode them as control characters is exactly what §2.3 exists to refuse. `^C`
arrives as `'c'` with the control modifier set and means whatever its reader
decides; there is no byte anywhere in the system that has to be recognised as an
interrupt, and nothing to mis-parse.

`key()` only queues. Like `wake()`, it never resumes a coroutine, so an event
arriving from the host cannot re-enter the scheduler — and because the worker is
single-threaded and `tick()` is a synchronous call, it cannot arrive mid-tick
anyway. The rule is kept for the same reason `wake()` keeps it: it makes the
question moot for every event source added later. The corresponding obligation
on the host is that `key()` and `resize()` are each followed by `pump()`, since
an idle kernel has no timer armed and queued work would otherwise wait forever.

### Reflow keeps the rows in use, not the bottom of the grid

"Window resize reflows" has three plausible readings. Full re-wrapping of
logical lines is the one a modern terminal does, and it needs a per-row
continuation bit and a notion of line length that the grid does not have; that
is properly M7's, where the layout layer decides who owns line structure.
Keeping the top-left corner is not a reflow but a crop, and it discards
precisely the recent output the user is looking at.

Keeping the bottom-most rows is the obvious remaining answer, and it is wrong in
the common case: a 24-row screen holding one line of output has its text at the
top, so keeping the bottom five rows of it keeps five blank rows and throws the
text away. The smoke test caught exactly that on the boot banner. What survives
is the rows *in use* — `0..cursor_y` — dropping from the top when they no longer
fit and landing at the top of the new grid, since output grows downwards and
that is where the eye already is. A full screen still keeps its bottom, because
there the rows in use are the whole grid.

The wrap is deferred for the same reason: the cursor parks at `cursor_x == cols`
after the last column is filled and only descends when the next character
arrives. Wrapping eagerly would scroll the screen the moment a line reached the
right edge, before there was anything to put on the next one.

### The renderer, and where the font lives

Rendering is the ~300 lines of JavaScript §2.3 promises, in `web/render.js`, and
it does exactly one thing: read cells, draw glyphs. It never calls back into the
kernel — `host_present` runs synchronously inside `tick()`, so a call the other
way would re-enter the scheduler mid-drain. That rule is written next to the
import.

The split between page and worker follows what each one can know. The page owns
the pixel box and reports it in device pixels via `ResizeObserver`'s
`devicePixelContentBoxSize`, which is already correct under fractional zoom; it
also has to watch `devicePixelRatio` with a `matchMedia` query re-armed at each
new ratio, because moving a window to another monitor changes it and nothing
else reports that. The worker owns the font, so it owns the metrics and
therefore the geometry: it measures a glyph, divides, and calls `resize`.
`devicePixelRatio` does not exist in a worker at all, which settles the question
of who computes what. Advance widths are fractional, so the cell width is
rounded once and every glyph is placed at `col * cellW` rather than letting the
font advance across a row; a startup check compares `M` against `i` and warns if
the font turned out not to be monospaced, because that failure otherwise looks
like a kernel bug.

There is no blinking cursor. A blink needs a timer, `tick()` would then never
return `-1`, and the page would never go idle — a visual flourish is not worth a
kernel that never sleeps. `transferControlToOffscreen` has no fallback: without
`SharedArrayBuffer` the main thread cannot see the kernel's memory, so
main-thread rendering is not available at any price, and its absence is reported
rather than worked around.

### What the smoke test now proves

`init` creates an 80×24 grid before anything else, so the kernel is never in a
screenless state and the boot banner has somewhere to go. The host's first
`resize` then reflows that banner into the measured geometry, which makes the
reflow path visible on every page load rather than only when someone drags a
window.

Both M2 criteria are checked against the shipping `kernel.wasm`, not only
against `tests.wasm`: the smoke test resizes, types through `key()`, and asserts
the codepoints landed in the right cells, that the cursor advanced, and that
exactly one `host_present` arrived covering the two written cells *and* the cell
the cursor left. Then it shrinks the screen and asserts the text survived with
the cursor still inside the grid, and that an absurd geometry comes back
clamped. The M1 assertions are unchanged and still pass: the console task
suspends on a channel rather than a timer, so it cannot perturb the tick delays
the M1 test pins down.

---

## M1 — Scheduler

`Task<T>`, a ready queue, a timer queue, wake tokens, `tick()`, `wake()`,
`sleep_ms` and cancellation — the kernel core §3.3 describes, plus the `HashMap`
and `String` that M0 deferred. 8,625 bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against the same 32
KiB budget.

### Timers belong to the kernel, not the host

§3.4 listed both a `host_timer(token, ms)` import and a `tick(now_ms)` that
"returns ms-until-next-timer, or -1". Those overlap: the second only means
anything if the kernel knows when its next deadline is, and if it knows that,
the first is redundant. Only one of them can be the design.

The kernel keeps the timer queue. `sleep_ms` inserts a deadline, `tick` fires
whatever has come due and reports the delay to the next one, and the host's
entire timing responsibility is `setTimeout(pump, delay)`. This wins on three
counts. There is one host timer outstanding instead of one per sleeping task.
The import surface stays at two, so the smoke test's assertion that nothing new
appeared is still a meaningful statement about libc. And, most usefully, the
clock is a *parameter*: tests call `tick(0)`, `tick(10)`, `tick(15)` and assert
exact wake ordering with no real time involved and nothing to flake. Both M1
acceptance criteria are checked that way, in `tests.wasm` and again against the
real `kernel.wasm` in the smoke test.

§3.4 is amended to say so. The rounding in `tick`'s return is deliberately
upward, so the host never wakes before a deadline and re-arms for the remaining
fraction of a millisecond.

### Cancellation rides in the promise

§8.1 asks that `CancelToken` participate in every awaitable from this milestone
on. The obvious reading is a parameter — `sleep_ms(500, token)` — but a rule
enforced by remembering to pass an argument is not enforced at all, and it puts
the token in every signature in the system.

Instead the promise carries a `CancelState *`, and every awaiter's
`await_suspend` is templated on the promise type:

```cpp
template <class P> bool await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<P> h) {
    w_.cancel = h.promise().cancel;
```

The compiler hands `await_suspend` a `coroutine_handle<promise_type>`, so an
awaiter can reach the *awaiting* coroutine's state without being told about it.
`Task`'s own awaiter copies the pointer from parent to child, which is where
§3.6's "cancellation propagates down the tree" comes from: it is one assignment,
made structurally, rather than a tree walk. The cost is that every awaitable in
the kernel must be awaited from a `Task` — acceptable, since that is what a
process is.

Killing sets the flag and, if the tree is suspended, pulls its waiter out of the
timer queue or wake table and puts it back on the ready queue. It then resumes
normally, sees the flag, and returns `Err(Error::Cancelled)`. Nothing is
destroyed from outside: the coroutine unwinds by returning, exactly as §3.6
requires, and its destructors run on the ordinary path. A task that is on the
ready queue rather than suspended needs no special handling — its next
`await_suspend` sees the flag and declines to suspend.

That propagation only works if errors actually propagate, and here M0 had left a
trap: `TRY` expands to a plain `return`, which is ill-formed inside a coroutine.
`CO_TRY` and `CO_TRY_VOID` are the same macros with `co_return`, and they live
beside `TRY` so the trap and its fix are read together. A process root is
different — it converts the error to an exit code rather than propagating it —
so the demo and the test tasks check the `Result` explicitly instead.

### The waiter lives in the coroutine frame

§3.3 describes the suspended-task table as `HashMap<u32, coroutine_handle<>>`.
What is stored is a `Waiter *` instead: a small record holding the handle, the
cancel state, the token, and room for the payload that `wake(token, ptr, len)`
already promises to deliver.

The record lives *inside* the suspended coroutine's frame — it is a member of
the awaiter, which the language guarantees stays alive across the suspension. So
registering a wait allocates nothing, and `wake()` has somewhere to put a
payload that the awaiter can read on resume without a second lookup. Nothing
about the table's shape changes; it just has a value type with more than one
field in it.

The cost of a pointer into a frame is that destroying the frame must not leave
it behind, so every awaiter deregisters in its destructor. That is the one rule
this design has to get right, and it is what makes `sched_reset()` — and, later,
killing a process mid-await — safe rather than a use-after-free.

`wake()` only queues. It never resumes a coroutine, so an event arriving from JS
in the middle of a `tick()` cannot re-enter the scheduler. An unknown token is
ignored rather than an error: a wake arriving after its task was cancelled is
normal traffic, not a fault.

### Scheduler state is allocated, not static

A `Vec` or `HashMap` at namespace scope has a non-trivial destructor, and clang
registers those with `__cxa_atexit` from the static-init function — which
`--no-entry` never calls, but which still references a symbol nothing provides.
Under M0's deliberate removal of `--allow-undefined` that is a link error, and
rightly so.

So the scheduler's state is one struct behind a pointer, built on first use. The
global is a plain pointer, there is no static initialisation to worry about, and
the reset that unit tests need between cases falls out for free: destroy the
struct and drop the pointer. Its destructor runs jobs down first, so suspended
frames are destroyed while the queues they point into are still alive.

### Queues sized for the actual workload

The ready queue is a `Vec` with a head cursor rather than a deque: it is drained
to empty on every tick, so the cursor never travels far and the storage is
reused rather than reallocated.

The timer queue is a `Vec` sorted with the earliest deadline last, so firing
pops from the back in O(1) and inserting is a bubble through a list that is a
handful of entries long in any real workload. A binary heap would improve the
insert and make the removal worse — and removal by waiter is exactly what
cancellation needs, which is a linear scan in a heap too.

Both are honest bets on scale rather than defaults, and both are contained: the
ready queue and timer queue are private to `sched.cpp` and can be replaced
without touching an awaitable.

### `HashMap`, shaped by the wake table

Open addressing with linear probing, power-of-two capacity, tombstones, doubling
at three quarters full. Integer keys go through murmur3's finalizer, because
sequential wake tokens are the primary key type and the identity hash would turn
the table into a single long probe run. There is an FNV-1a overload for `Str`
keys, which the M3 program registry will want.

Slots are one array of `{key, value, state}` rather than parallel arrays. The
kernel's tables are small and looked up one key at a time, so the cache argument
for splitting them does not apply, and one array is half the allocation
bookkeeping. Insertion returns `false` on OOM in the same style as `Vec`.

### `sleep_ms` is a `Task`, and that costs a frame

The awaitable underneath `sleep_ms` is enough on its own — `co_await Sleep(500)`
would work and allocate nothing. It is still wrapped in a `Task<Result<void>>`,
because §3.3's "every syscall is one of these" is worth more than one
allocation: syscalls compose, cancel and propagate errors uniformly precisely
because they are all the same type. §8.2 says the allocator is built for
coroutine frames as its primary workload, so this is spending exactly what that
was built to spend.

### The demo, and what the smoke test now proves

`init` spawns two tasks that sleep past each other — a at 10 ms and 30 ms, b at
15 ms and 25 ms. They cost a few hundred bytes of the budget and they earn it
twice: a bare page shows the scheduler working with no shell to drive it, and
the smoke test drives `tick()` on a synthetic clock and asserts both the log
order and the exact sequence of returned delays. The first acceptance criterion
is therefore checked against the shipping binary, not only against `tests.wasm`.
M3's shell replaces them.

M0's `coroutine_ok()` boot self-check is gone. It existed to prove the shim
linked and ran; the demo now does that far more thoroughly, and one of the two
had to go.

---

## M0 — Nucleus

The first milestone: a freestanding wasm build, the `<coroutine>` shim, the
allocator, the base core types, and one line of output in a browser tab. 4,013
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against a 32 KiB budget.

### The build command line changed in three ways

Appendix C of the concept document records a compiler invocation verified before
any code existed. Building something real against it turned up three problems,
all confirmed by compiling and instantiating modules rather than by reading
documentation.

**`-Wl,--export-dynamic` is not a reliable way to export.** In a test module it
exported the mangled `operator new` and `operator delete` while silently
dropping a plain `extern "C" start()`. Whatever rule it follows, it is not
"export what I wrote", and a build system whose ABI surface is decided by linker
heuristics is a bad foundation. Every export is now named individually with
`__attribute__((export_name("...")))`, wrapped in the `BRAAM_EXPORT` macro. The
`used` attribute goes with it, because `--gc-sections` would otherwise drop a
function nothing calls. The result is an export section that contains exactly
what we asked for and nothing else, which is a thing the smoke test can assert
against.

**`-Wl,--allow-undefined` is not just unnecessary — it is actively bad here.**
Its purpose is to let unresolved symbols become imports. But imports are now
declared explicitly with
`__attribute__((import_module("host"), import_name("...")))`, so there is
nothing left for it to resolve. Dropping it converts a whole class of mistake
from runtime to link time: a stray libc call — `strlen`, say, reached through
some header we did not expect — used to become a silent import that traps when
first called. It is now `wasm-ld: error: undefined symbol: strlen` before the
binary exists. For a project whose entire premise is "we link nothing we did not
write", having the linker enforce that claim is worth more than the flag it
costs.

The related worry, that `memcpy` and `memset` would leak in as imports, turned
out to be unfounded: `__wasm_bulk_memory__` is on by default for this target, so
LLVM lowers them inline to `memory.copy` and `memory.fill`. A 4 KiB struct copy
produced a module whose only import was `host.log`. No hand-written `mem*`
functions are needed, and if that ever changes the missing symbol is now a link
error rather than a mystery trap.

**`--no-default-config` and `-Wl,--stack-first` are new.** The first suppresses
`bin/clang++.cfg`, which unconditionally injects `--sysroot=.../wasi-sysroot`.
It is harmless under `-nostdlib -nostdinc++`, but the whole point of using this
SDK as a bare clang is that nothing of its comes along uninvited, and
determinism costs one flag. The second moves the shadow stack below the data
segment. By default the stack sits above the data and grows down into it, so an
overflow quietly corrupts globals; with `--stack-first` it grows down towards
address zero and runs off the bottom of linear memory, which traps. Concept.md
§8.4 asks that this class of bug fail loudly, and this is the same argument
applied to the stack.

### The coroutine shim

Appendix C is right that libc++'s `<coroutine>` cannot be used freestanding, and
right about the shim being roughly 25 lines. One detail it does not mention, and
which costs an afternoon if missed: `std::coroutine_traits` must be defined, not
merely declared. A forward declaration compiles fine until the first coroutine,
which then fails with "implicit instantiation of undefined template". The
primary template needs its body —
`using promise_type = typename R::promise_type;`.

`coroutine_handle<P>` derives publicly from `coroutine_handle<void>` rather than
holding a pointer and offering a conversion operator, which is how libc++ does
it. Inheritance gives the derived-to-base conversion for free; writing the
conversion operator as well earns a `-Wclass-conversion` warning, because it can
never be selected.

`noop_coroutine` is included even though nothing uses it yet. `Task<T>`'s
`final_suspend` in M1 will want it as the "resume nobody" case in symmetric
transfer, and the shim is the wrong place to be adding pieces under time
pressure.

The test suite pins down more of the shim's behaviour than M0 strictly needs,
deliberately. It checks that destroying a *suspended* coroutine runs the
destructors of locals held across the suspend point — which is precisely the
contract cancellation depends on in M1 (§8.1) — and that `await_suspend`
returning a handle transfers control to it, which is what makes `Task<T>`
chaining work without growing the stack.

### The allocator: spans, not headers

Coroutine frames are the hot path (§8.2), and frames are freed through
`operator delete`, which does not always know the size. The usual answer is a
header word before each block recording its size class; the usual cost is that a
16-byte allocation becomes 32 bytes once alignment is preserved, which is a 100%
overhead on the most common size.

Instead, linear memory is carved into 64 KiB **spans**, and each span serves
exactly one size class. A side table maps span index to class, so `free(p)`
finds the class with `span_class[p >> 16]`. There is no per-allocation header at
all, 16-byte alignment falls out of the class sizes, and sized and unsized
`delete` are the same O(1) operation. This is the structure jemalloc and
mimalloc use, for the same reason.

Allocation within a span is a bump pointer with a per-class free list in front
of it, so a freshly claimed span costs nothing to prepare — no carving loop
threading 4,096 blocks onto a list before the first allocation can be served.

Allocations over 512 bytes take whole span runs. Their free list is
address-ordered with coalescing on insert, which is the old K&R arrangement.
Coalescing is not needed for correctness, and skipping it would have been
simpler, but `Vec` growth reallocates repeatedly and each cycle would strand a
run that nothing could ever reuse. Address-ordered insertion makes both
neighbours cheap to find, and the free-run list is short in practice because
small allocations never touch it.

The span table is a fixed `u8[4096]`, capping the heap at 256 MiB. Sizing it for
wasm32's full 4 GiB would cost 64 KiB of zero-initialised memory for a limit no
browser tab will approach. The array is `.bss`, so it costs nothing in the
binary either way; the cap is about honesty, not bytes, and raising it is a
one-line change.

One consequence worth knowing before it looks like a bug: reserved memory grows
in 64 KiB units *per size class*. Boot reserves 320 KiB for five allocations,
because a `Vec` growing through 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-byte capacities touches
five different classes and each claims a span. This is fine — the memory is
reserved, not used, and steady-state behaviour is what matters — but the number
surprises on first sight.

### The heap base convention

Concept.md §3.4 fixes `init(heap_base)`, but in M0 the host has no way to know
where the kernel's data ends. Rather than export the layout to JS so JS can hand
it straight back, `init` treats a base of `0` as "use the linker's
`__heap_base`". The signature stays as specified, the host stays ignorant of the
kernel's memory map, and M8 — where an isolated process really is handed a base
chosen by its parent — needs no ABI change.

### Errors, and the shape of `TRY`

`TRY(expr)` is a statement expression (`({ ... })`), a GNU extension that clang
implements, which is why `CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS` is `ON` and the standard is
`gnu++20` rather than `c++20`. The alternative — a macro that assigns into a
caller-declared variable — reads badly at every call site, and this is a
construct that will appear in nearly every kernel function.

Early return needs a value convertible to *any* `Result<U, E>`, so errors travel
as a small `ErrTag<E>` returned by `Err(e)`, which each `Result` has a
converting constructor for. That is the standard trick and it costs nothing at
runtime.

`TRY_VOID` exists because `TRY` unwraps a value and `Result<void, E>` has none.
Two macros is mildly unfortunate; the alternative was making
`Result<void, E>::value()` return a dummy, which would be worse.

### Verification

Tests run headlessly under Node, which stands in for the browser perfectly well:
a freestanding module needs nothing browser-specific to instantiate.
`test/run.mjs` has two modes.

The `--kernel` mode asserts the *exact* import and export lists. This looks
pedantic for two imports and two exports, but the ABI is the thing most likely
to drift silently, and an unexpected import is precisely the signature of an
accidental libc dependency. The check costs one line and catches a category of
problem that is otherwise invisible until runtime.

The `--tests` mode drives `tests.wasm`, a separate binary linking the same core
library. Two binaries rather than a compile-time flag, so test code can never
count against the kernel's size budget and the number the budget checks is the
number that ships.

`tests.wasm` lists its cases explicitly in `main.cpp` rather than
self-registering at static init. Self-registration needs `__wasm_call_ctors`,
which `--no-entry` leaves uncalled, and that question is better settled in M3
where the program registry (§3.6) actually depends on it.

Writing the tests found two real bugs, which is the argument for having written
them: `Str::split` read its own fields after overwriting them when the output
parameter aliased `*this` — the natural way to write a tokenising loop — and the
first attempt to assert that coroutine frames come from the kernel heap failed
because clang had elided the allocation entirely. The second is not a bug in the
allocator but in the test: heap allocation elision is a permitted optimisation,
so the test now routes the frame through a `noinline` factory that lets the
handle escape, which is the situation the scheduler will actually create in M1.

### Size budget

32,768 bytes for `kernel.wasm`, from Concept.md's "~30 KB" rounded to something
page-friendly. M0 uses 12% of it. The number is deliberately not tight: its job
is to make growth *visible* and deliberate, and a budget that has to be edited
every commit stops being read. CI prints the figure into the job summary on
every run, so the trend is visible without anyone going looking.
