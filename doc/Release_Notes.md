# Release notes

Reasoning, alternatives and trade-offs behind the code. Comments in the source
say *what* a thing is; this file says *why* it is that way.
[Concept.md](Concept.md) remains the specification — where this document and the
spec disagree about intent, the spec wins and one of the two needs amending.

What has been written for the release after 0.8 is below, under a heading of its
own; the next goes above it, and all of them move to [releases/](releases/) when
the release is cut.

Releases before this one are one file each in [releases/](releases/), newest
first:

- [0.8](releases/Release_Notes-v0.8.md) — the screens a page can hold, and the
  libc it never linked
- [0.7](releases/Release_Notes-v0.7.md) — the devices a port opens, and the
  menus the browser already had
- [0.6](releases/Release_Notes-v0.6.md) — the programs a script assumed were
  there
- [0.5](releases/Release_Notes-v0.5.md) — a system a program can be written
  for, not only in
- [0.4](releases/Release_Notes-v0.4.md) — a system that can install software it
  was not built with
- [0.3](releases/Release_Notes-v0.3.md) — a shell with a language, and files
  with names of their own
- [0.2](releases/Release_Notes-v0.2.md) — a version that names the commit, and
  one program model
- [0.1.0](releases/Release_Notes-v0.1.md) — packaging, and M0–M9 with the
  criteria they were accepted against

## The kit ships an `endian.h` after all, and CI is why

0.8 argued that `braam::compat` should not supply `<endian.h>`: clang derives
the order from `__BYTE_ORDER__` and carries the whole `htobe`/`letoh` family,
and its answer is better than a hardcoded little-endian one. That argument
stands. What it missed is *which* clang — the freestanding `<endian.h>` arrived
in clang 23, and CI runs the distribution's, which on ubuntu-latest is 18.1.3.
`test/unit/test_compat.cpp` had never reached CI before the 0.8 push, since the
four commits that introduced it were local until then, and it failed there with
`'endian.h' file not found` on a tree whose three suites pass at home.

So the header is the kit's, in [limits.h](../src/compat/include/limits.h)'s
shape rather than as a replacement: `#include_next` when the compiler has one,
and the same names derived from the same predefines when it does not. A clang 23
build is byte-for-byte what it was — it reaches clang's header through one more
file — and a clang 18 build now works at all. The rejected alternative was
pinning CI to a versioned clang from apt.llvm.org: it would fix this one
symptom, and it would move the toolchain floor from "a C++20 clang" to "clang
23" for every consumer of the SDK, which is a much larger claim to make for a
header that is thirty lines of `__builtin_bswap`.

The fallback branch cannot be exercised on a machine whose clang has the real
header, which is the honest limit of the test: `test_endian` checks whichever
branch the compiler took, and the two now have to be checked on two compilers.
CI is the second one, which is the whole point.

`<float.h>` is still not wrapped, and must not be — `src/math/` overrides
`LDBL_*` for its vendored sources and a port must not inherit that lie.

Separately, the three actions leave Node 20, which GitHub is forcing onto Node
24 and warning about on every run. `checkout` and `setup-node` go to `v5`, which
is the first of each that targets Node 24; `upload-artifact`'s `v5` still does
not, so it goes to `v6` — its `v7` is an ESM rewrite with a new direct-upload
mode, and none of that is wanted for one `path:`.
