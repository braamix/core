# Release notes

Reasoning, alternatives and trade-offs behind the code. Comments in the source
say *what* a thing is; this file says *why* it is that way.
[Concept.md](Concept.md) remains the specification — where this document and the
spec disagree about intent, the spec wins and one of the two needs amending.

## The last operation that could blank somebody else's screen

TODO.md's N1: `ScreenClear` was the one operation in the terminal block with no
authorisation check at all, so any process could blank the grid a full-screen
program was painting. It now refuses while another process holds the alternate
screen. The wire does not move — same op number, same empty argument and
payload, so `PROC_ABI` stays where it is. What moved is the answer.

**This supersedes "`ScreenBlit` is checked; `ScreenClear` is not"**, further
down this file, which stands where it is. That note argued the operation should
stay open "because `clear` and `watch` blank the shell's own screen without ever
claiming it, and refusing them would be a change to two programs to enforce a
rule about a third". The reasoning was sound and the arithmetic was wrong: it
priced the fix against `ScreenBlit`'s guard, which is the only one in the block
that would have cost those programs anything.

**There are two guard shapes, and this one is not a blit's.** `ScreenBlit` and
`KeyRead` ask *do you hold it* — `!p.alt` and `!p.keys` — because a blit is what
the claim exists for. `Cursor`'s set, `Style` and `Echo` ask the weaker
question, *does somebody else hold it*: `tty_screen_owner()` non-zero and not
the caller's pid. `ScreenClear` belongs with the second three, and taking their
test verbatim costs its callers nothing, because all of them run with the screen
free. The old note counted three programs where there are three callers and one
of them is not a program: `/bin/clear`, `watch`'s repaint, and the shell's `^L`,
which that note missed.

**The strict shape was not available anyway.** A `/bin/clear` that took the
screen to satisfy `!p.alt` would blank nothing: `~FullScreen` copies its
snapshot back, so claim-clear-release is a no-op by construction. The shell
could not have claimed for `^L` either — the prompt lives *on* the scrolling
grid, and taking the alternate screen is what hides it. An operation whose only
callers cannot satisfy a rule does not have that rule; it has the other one.

**A holder may still clear its own grid**, which is what `owner != p.pid` says
rather than `!owner`. Nothing does today — `edit` and `less` paint by blitting a
grid of their own — but refusing it would be a rule with no argument behind it,
and the three neighbours it copies do not refuse it either.

Nothing else changed. The callers were left alone: all three already returned
1 (or `Err(Io)`) on any error from the call, and a diagnostic would be written
to a grid the holder is painting over and the restore then puts back, which is
the same reason the test below writes its answer to a file.

**The test is the pipeline, not a background job.** `test/smoke/fullscreen.mjs`
runs `edit /home/m7.txt | sh -c 'sleep -m 200; clear; echo $? > /home/n1'`: the
editor takes the screen, the second stage's timer fires under it, and the clear
is refused. `&` would have been the natural way to put a second process beside a
foreground one, but `g_next_id` in `sh/job.cpp` only climbs, so a job taken here
would renumber `jobs.mjs`'s `[1]` two cases later — the cumulative session's
cost, and the reason the sleep does the ordering instead. Two assertions,
because the failure has two faces: the holder's grid still reads `hXello`, and
`/home/n1` reads 1. Before the change the first of those is a blank screen.

The line is typed in three goes because `KEY_RING` is 32 and `type()` does not
tick between characters, so a 71-character command loses its tail. That is the
ring's documented policy rather than a bug, but it is the kind of thing a case
discovers the hard way.

## `pkg upgrade` learns operands, and the pin learns how to come off

The section below says "**`pkg upgrade` keeps its no-operand form.** `pkg
upgrade hello` remains a usage error rather than a second spelling of the new
`install`: one command per act." That was written a commit ago and it is now
wrong, as is P20's older "There are no operands here … so an argument is a usage
error". Both stand where they are; this supersedes them. What changed is not the
reasoning but what the two commands are for.

**The act really is different, which is why it is an operand and not a second
command.** `install` adds a root to `/pkg/world` and then makes the world
consistent; `upgrade` adds nothing and never installs anything new. Both can be
asked to move one package, and asking `upgrade` to do it leaves world's shape
alone — which is precisely what you want when the package is already a
dependency of something else and you do not want it promoted to explicit.

**Without operands nothing moved.** `in.flags = SOLVE_UPGRADE` is the run-wide
flag over everything world reaches, and that is still exactly what a bare `pkg
upgrade` does. With operands it clears that and flags the named packages instead
— apk's own upgrade branch, whose second half we had not built.

**The flag inherits, where apk's `upgrade <pkg>` passes 0.**
`SolveRequest{name, SOLVE_UPGRADE, SOLVE_UPGRADE}`, the same pair `install` now
uses. apk confines it to the named name; we do not, for the reason the previous
section gives — a package upgraded onto libraries older than anything it was
built against is the state nobody wants and the one hardest to notice.
`test/unit/solve.data`'s `upgrade3.test` still models apk's shape and still
passes, because `apply_args` mirrors apk's applets, not ours — and the property
that fixture proves, an operand moving that name and leaving world's other
members alone, is the one we needed.

**The unpin is part of the act rather than a flag.** The previous commit made a
sideloaded archive pin itself in world as `name=version`, and left `pkg install
<name>` as the only way off. That is a poor pair: to get the newest version of a
package you have to type the command that adds roots. `pkg upgrade <name>` now
drops the clause, so the two ways of saying "stop holding this here" are the two
commands that could have meant it.

**Any version clause, not only `=`.** `world_unpin` clears `hello=1.0-r0`,
`hello>=1.0` and `hello~2.2` alike. One rule is easier to hold than two, and the
distinction between a pin `pkg install` wrote and a constraint someone typed is
not one the file records — both are the same sentence in §6's grammar. A `!name`
conflict is skipped: it is not a hold, and rewriting it as `name` would silently
invert it. That is the whole reason `world_unpin` tests `VER_CONFLICT`, and
`test_db.cpp` pins it, since no smoke fixture plants a conflict into world.

It needs no allocation. `dep_parse` sets `d.name` to a view of the spec's own
first bytes, so taking the clause off is `had = d.name` — the same block, a
shorter view. Every line naming the package, not the first, for the reason
`world_drop`'s comment gives.

**A name nothing installed answers to is refused**, `pkg: <name>: not installed`
and 1, which is what `pkg files` and `pkg verify` already say. `pkg remove
nonesuch` is silent about the same mistake, and that is right there — a removal
that finds nothing to remove got what it asked for. An upgrade did not: it will
never install the name, so a typo has no other way to surface. The check is over
the installed stanzas rather than the generation's `packages` file, so
`pkg upgrade cmd:hi` resolves through `p:` the way every other name in this
program does; `survives` and it now share one `stanza_provides`.

**The usage block got two columns wider.** `upgrade [<package>...]` is 22
characters against `install <package>...`'s 20, and `usage()` computes the
description column from the widest row — so every description moved right, and
the `-v, --verbose` line in `HEAD`, which is aligned to that column *by hand*,
moved with it. The note at the top of this file predicted this exact ripple when
the table was built. The `-v` row is now 61 characters and no longer fits the
smoke suite's 60-column grid, so `pkgcli` resizes around it as `pkg-update`
already does for `pkg search`.

## Installing something installed is upgrading it

`pkg install hello` used to print `generation 1, unchanged` when the index had
moved on, and P20's note called that "the difference between the two commands
stated as a test". It was the wrong difference to have. Nobody types `install`
to be told nothing happened, and the command that would have done what they
meant — `pkg upgrade` — moves *everything* world reaches, which is a much
larger act than the one asked for. The distinction that is worth keeping is
scope, not freshness: `install` moves what you name, `upgrade` moves the lot.

**One line of the plumbing, because the solver already had the knob.**
`pkg_install` pushes `SolveRequest{name, SOLVE_UPGRADE, SOLVE_UPGRADE}` instead
of no flags at all. `compare_providers` has an `ipkg` rung above the version
comparison that is skipped under `SOLVE_UPGRADE`
([solve.cpp:769](../src/cmd/pkg/solve.cpp#L769)), which is the whole of why the
installed copy used to win. Nothing in `src/cmd/pkg/solve.cpp` changed, and no
new case was needed in `test/unit/solve.data`: apk's own `basic17` is
`add --upgrade a`, which `test_solve.cpp` already turns into exactly this pair
of flags.

**Per-name, not the run-wide flag `pkg upgrade` sets.** apk's upgrade branch
sets the run-wide flag and, given operands, clears it and flags the named
packages instead; this is that second form, reached from `install`. So world's
other members are untouched — `pkg install hello` cannot quietly bump something
that merely happens to be installed beside it.

**The third field is `SOLVE_UPGRADE` too, so it inherits.** A package's
dependencies move with it. The alternative — flag the operand alone and let
dependencies move only where a constraint forces them — leaves a package
upgraded onto libraries older than anything it was ever built against, which is
the state nobody wants and the one hardest to notice. apk's `add` inherits for
the same reason.

**A sideload now pins its version, and that is not a separate feature.** Once
`install` prefers what is new, an archive joining `/pkg/world` under its bare
name loses to a newer installed copy — `pkg install ./hello-0.9.zip` would have
printed `unchanged` and thrown the bytes away. So an archive joins as
`<name>=<version>`, apk's `apk_dep_from_pkg`, and installs what it named
whichever way the versions compare. `world_push` replaces by name, so naming
the package afterwards clears the pin; until then `pkg upgrade` leaves it
alone, which is what a pin is for.

`pin_spec` falls back to the bare name when `<name>=<version>` does not parse
back to the same two halves. §3.2 holds `V` to a *path component*, not to §7's
version grammar, so a sideload may legitimately carry a `V` that `dep_parse`
calls broken — and a broken dependency satisfies nothing, so pinning one would
have turned a package that installs today into one that cannot be resolved. A
name carrying `<`, `>`, `=` or `~` fails the same check and takes the same
route. `test/smoke/pkg-local.mjs` installs a `V:!!` to hold that open.

**The `installed at a different digest` refusal is now reachable from a second
command.** P20's analysis of `pkg upgrade` applies verbatim: skipping the early
`ipkg` rung means a local record and an index that disagree about the metadata
of one name-version can produce a `Replacing`, which `stem_state` refuses
because §8 makes a store directory immutable and a rollback target may be
executing out of it. The refusal is still the right answer; there is simply one
more way to arrive at it.

**`pkg upgrade` keeps its no-operand form.** `pkg upgrade hello` remains a usage
error rather than a second spelling of the new `install`: one command per act.

The smoke suite's `pkg-upgrade` case used to assert the old behaviour in one
line. It now spends a generation on the new one instead — rolled back to 1.0-r0
with nothing serving the archive, `pkg install hello` moves it to 1.1-r0 out of
the store directory that is already there, which also shows `stem_state`
skipping a fetch it does not need.

## `basename` and `dirname`, and the pair that was not already there

`doc/TODO.md` A2 said the work was done — "`src/fs/path.cpp` already has both".
It does not. `path_basename` and `path_dirname` take what the VFS deals in: an
absolute path that `path_resolve` has already normalised, with no trailing
slash and no empty component. Handed what a shell script hands `dirname`, they
answer `path_dirname("foo") == "f"`, `path_dirname("") == ""` and
`path_basename("foo/") == "/"` — each of them right for the caller they were
written for and wrong here.

**So the semantics stay apart.** POSIX's pair is string work over arbitrary
text: it opens nothing, resolves nothing, and has never heard of a working
directory. The VFS's pair is a step in resolution. Putting both in `path.cpp`
would have put two functions one adjective apart in a header that **every
binary in the tree links** — `src/proc/` compiles `path.cpp` in — where picking
the wrong one is a silent bug rather than a link error. What is reused is
`path_basename`, at the one point where the two agree: once the trailing
slashes are trimmed and the all-slashes path has answered `/`, the tail after
the last separator is the same tail. `dirname`'s rule is written out, because
dropping the separator *and the run in front of it* is what makes `a//b` say
`a`, and the kernel's version has no reason to do that.

**GNU's flags, not POSIX's minimum.** `basename` takes `-a` and `-s <suffix>`
as well as `<path> [<suffix>]`; `dirname` takes several operands. The suffix
form earns its place twice over here: this shell has no `${x%.c}` — the four
operators in Shell.md §6 are the whole set — so stripping an extension has no
other spelling. `-z` is left out: nothing in the tree reads NUL-separated
input, and the program that would (`xargs`, A7) is not built yet. One rule
worth writing down: a name that is *only* the suffix keeps it, so
`basename .c .c` is `.c` rather than nothing.

**They are programs, not builtins.** Both are pure string work whose whole cost
is the spawn, which is the second half of CLAUDE.md's builtin test — but that
set is closed at `test`, `[`, `:`, `echo`, `true` and `false`, and widening it
is a design change to argue in Concept.md first, not a thing to slip in with
two programs. A loop that calls `dirname` once a turn pays a worker a turn;
that is what the shell's own `$(…)` costs everywhere else.

9.5 KB and 7.4 KB, against §4.4's duplication; `rootfs/` is 1.26 MB of the 2 MB
budget.

**A line in `/etc/help` is somebody else's arithmetic, again.** Two entries went
in and three lines with them — `basename`'s wraps — and `test/smoke/subst.mjs`
concatenates that document three times and asserts what `wc` prints over it:
`345 2613 17385` became `354 2718 17994`. Its comment claimed "17,148 bytes is
thirty-four chunks against eight slots", which was already two changes out of
date — the byte count predates the last `/etc/help` edit and the chunk count
predates `SYS_READ_MAX`. The count is gone rather than re-derived: what a deep
pipeline now costs is TODO C2, to be measured rather than asserted in a
comment.

`doc/Shell.md` §14 gained three rows rather than two: it was missing `cp`, left
out when that landed.

---

## `/bin/cp`, and the copy that was already here three times

The system had `mv` and no `cp`. The copy was not missing — it was written
three times over: `copy_file` and `copy_tree` in `src/cmd/mv.cpp`, the same loop
open-coded in `src/cmd/fimport.cpp`, and the extract path in `/bin/pkg`.
`mv.cpp`'s comment said so outright ("fimport.cpp's loop") and nothing acted on
it.

Both now live in `src/proc/io.h`, which is where the header already said this
belongs — "the few helpers a program would otherwise write again" — beside
`make_dir_all`. `mv` calls them rather than owning them, so this is a program
gained and a duplicate lost rather than code added. `--gc-sections` keeps them
out of a binary that does not copy.

`cp` takes `-r`, `-f`, `-i` and `-n`, and resolves its operands exactly as `mv`
does: with several sources the last is the directory they land in. A symbolic
link is recreated rather than followed, which is `copy_tree` descending on
`SYS_KIND_DIR` alone and is why it needs no cycle guard.

**What it does not do.** There is no `-p`, and there cannot be: OPFS cannot set
a modification time (`web/fs.js`'s `touch` rewrites a byte so the browser
restamps to *now*, then reads the stamp back rather than believing it). The
same limit is why **`mv` of a directory already restamps the whole tree** —
`FileSystemFileHandle.move` is `getFileHandle` only, so a directory rename is
always `Err(Unsupported)` and always falls into `copy_tree`. "A rename that is
sometimes a copy" was in the known gaps; that the copy loses every mtime was
not, and now is.

`copy_tree` requires its destination not to exist, so `cp -r a b` merges into an
existing `b/a` no more than `mv` does. Consistent rather than clever; recorded
in `doc/TODO`.

## A read is a span, not half a kilobyte

`SYS_READ_MAX` is 65,532 and `read_chunk` names it. `svc_chunk` yields 64 KiB.
**`PROC_ABI` does not move**, and that is the point.

**The arithmetic the old number rested on was wrong.** `SYS_CHUNK` was 512
because "`FS_BLOCK` is the allocator's top size class, and one byte more costs a
whole 64 KiB span" — but the reply is not 512 bytes, it is `4 + 512`. The status
word goes in first, and `String::reserve` doubles from 16, so 516 asks for 1024,
which is past `MAX_SMALL` and takes the large path: **a full 512-byte read has
always cost a whole span**, on both sides of the wire. Under the stated
reasoning the right value would have been 508. The question was never "should a
read start paying for a span" — it was already paying — but "should it get 128
times the data for the one it pays for".

**It clamps, so the ceiling is not ABI.** `Sys::Read`'s length has always been
an upper bound that the kernel may lower, and a short read has always been
legal with the remainder kept on the descriptor. So an old binary names no
length and still gets 512; a new one naming 65,532 to an older kernel gets 512
and loops. Nothing stamped is invalidated and no installed package breaks —
which is what makes this cheap now and is the first thing to doubt. T6
(below) was decided against a cost that was not there.

`SYS_READ_MAX` is `65536 - 4` rather than 65,536 so that the status word and a
full read together are one span exactly, and `sys_read_want` moved to
`sysabi.h`: it is a wire rule, both ends want it, and on the header it is
reachable from the unit suite.

**The caller was already there and already being refused.** `FdZipSource::read`
(`src/cmd/pkg/unzip.cpp`) asks for the whole remaining span of a zip entry — an
arbitrary number — and was silently cut to 512 and made to loop. That is
`/bin/unzip` and `/bin/pkg`, both shipped. `read_exactly` in `/bin/tail` is the
second. §4.3's "every operation has a caller in `src/cmd/`" is satisfied by code
that was written before this change.

**The workload T6 asked for is `pkg verify`**, which opens every installed file
and hashes it: 1.1 MB, some 2,210 reads, about 100 ms of round trips. It is now
about eighteen. `test/smoke/chunk.mjs` measures the invariant rather than the
figure — `wc` of a 64 KiB file against `wc` of a four-byte one, asserting the
difference in round trips is a handful and not a hundred and twenty-eight.

### The stream branch was dropping what it read

Raising `svc_chunk` first turned `pkg install` red, and the bug it found was
older than the change. `Sys::Read` served a pushback for a pipe and for
descriptor 0, and **not for a fetched body, a socket, an inflate stream or a
picked file** — those four called `chunk_keep`, which *stores* the remainder on
the handle, and then never looked at it again. It was invisible while the host
could not yield more than `want`: the remainder was always empty. With a 64 KiB
yield against a 512-byte `want`, every read past the first 512 bytes of a
downloaded archive went into a buffer nobody read, and the digest check caught
it. The check is now hoisted above the kind dispatch, so every kind that fills
`pend` is served from it — one place instead of two, which is why the third and
fourth were missed.

### What this costs

A pipe's eight `Channel` slots can now hold 512 KiB rather than 4 KiB, and
`BRAAM_BIN_INITIAL_PAGES` is four, so a 64 KiB `_alloc` puts `memory.grow` — and
§8.4's detached views — on the read path rather than on the rare path. The file
read is bounded by what the file has left, so a large `want` on a small file
does not take a span to fetch a handful of bytes. `test -x` was the one caller
that had to be told to ask for less: it decides from the magic or the `#!` line
and now names `PROC_SHEBANG_MAX`, or every `test -x` would pull 64 KiB off the
store — which is what the `static_assert` tying the two together was for.

---

## A descriptor can be told where to be

`Sys::Seek` is op 30, and `Sys::Read` grows an optional length. `PROC_ABI` moves
to 18.

**The position already existed; nothing could name it.** Everything below the
process is positional — `vfs_read(fd, off, …)`, `vfs_write`, `vfs_size` — and
deliberately stateless, because that is what lets several descriptors share one
backend handle under OPFS's exclusive lock (§5.2). The offset therefore had to
live *above* the VFS, and it does: `FileIo::off`, on the process's own `Handle`.
So the kernel has always known where each descriptor was, and a program had no
operation with which to ask or say. `SYS_O_APPEND` was the one thing that moved
it, open-coded as a flag; it is now a `Seek(0, SYS_SEEK_END)` folded into the
open, which leaves exactly one place in the system where a position becomes
something other than the next byte.

**Why the answer is data and not the status.** A position is a `u64` and the
status is an `i32`. Returning a truncated one would be wrong only past 2 GiB,
which is the worst kind of wrong: invisible until it is not. `Stat`, `Clock` and
`Storage` already answer 0 and put their wide values in the data.

**Why 0, 1 and 2 refuse.** They are not descriptors at all — they are the
`Stdio` the pipeline stage was handed, and there is no handle behind them to
move. Making them seekable means identifying a file-backed stream by comparing a
function pointer through a type-erased context, which `console_is_input` already
does once and which should not become a habit without §4.3 saying so. None of
the callers needs it.

**The length on `Read` is the more interesting half.** It exists because of a
bug the seek work uncovered rather than caused. `/bin/sh`'s `read` has to stop
at a newline, but a chunk is whatever the writer wrote, so it over-read and kept
the remainder in a process-global buffer keyed by the descriptor *number*.
Numbers are reused. A pushback left by one pipe was therefore matched against
the next pipe to be handed the same number, and prepended another stream's bytes
to a later line — a real corruption, sitting in the tree, reachable from two
ordinary pipelines in a row.

Seek fixes it for files and cannot fix it for pipes, which nothing can wind
back. A length can: the shell now reads a pipe a byte at a time and never takes
more than the line. That costs a syscall per byte on a non-seekable descriptor,
which is the price of correctness on a stream whose lines are short; a *file*
still reads a chunk at a time and seeks back, so the fast path is unchanged.

For a length to be honest on a stream, the bytes it does not cover cannot be
discarded — so the kernel keeps them, on the `Handle` for a descriptor and on
the process record for 0. That is the same buffer the shell was keeping, moved
to the one place where it belongs to the open description rather than to a
number: it dies with the handle, so a reused descriptor cannot inherit one. The
shell's global is gone, and with it the gap `Shell.md` used to list.

A `max` above `SYS_CHUNK` clamps rather than growing the read. 512 is
`FS_BLOCK`, the allocator's top size class on both sides of the wire (§8.2), and
one byte more costs a whole 64 KiB span — so the length may shorten a read and
must never lengthen one.

**Op 31 is left free** for the `Truncate` that `vfs_truncate` would need if
anything ever called it. §8's rule against growing the table on speculation says
not to add it now.

### `tail` stops reading the whole file

`tail -n 10` on a four-megabyte log was some eight thousand reads, because the
last line is the last one and there was no way to start anywhere else. It now
seeks to a window at the end and widens it — 512 bytes, doubling — until the
window holds the lines asked for. A window that starts mid-line begins with a
fragment of a line that is not ours, and dropping it is the whole subtlety.

The cost is a re-read of at most the final window, so under twice the bytes of
the answer, against the whole file before. `TAIL_WINDOW_MAX` stops the doubling
at a megabyte: a file that is one enormous line must not be pulled into memory
by a program that handled it before, so past the cap it reads the file through
as it always did. Any refusal to seek does the same, which makes the fallback
one path rather than two.

**The fast path is one named file only.** Several files are the last lines of
their *concatenation* — not GNU's per-file headers — and seeking backwards
through a reversed file list to preserve that is real complexity for something
nobody runs. Both paths feed the same ring and the same printer, so the bytes
out are the bytes out; `test/smoke/tail.mjs` asserts the two agree by running
`tail -n N file` against `cat file | tail -n N`, stdin being the thing that
cannot seek.

`Input` was left alone. It multiplexes several paths and stdin and opens them
one at a time, and handing out a descriptor would leak that into every caller
for one program's benefit.

### The zip reader reads through a source

A zip is read back to front — the directory is at the end — and with no way to
seek, the only way to reach it was to hold the whole archive. `zip_entries` took
a `Str` of the entire file, and `unzip -l big.zip` therefore read every byte of
it to print a listing.

It now takes a `ZipSource`: `size()`, and a read of exactly *n* bytes at an
offset. `/bin/unzip` implements it over a descriptor with `Sys::Seek`, and
`/bin/pkg` and the unit suite over a buffer they already hold. Parsing is two
reads — the end record, then the directory — plus a thirty-byte local header per
entry, whatever the archive weighs.

The first of those is twenty-two bytes, not the sixty-four kilobyte window the
format allows: an archive with no comment has its end record exactly at the end,
and that is every archive `tools/pack.py` writes. The window is read only when
those twenty-two bytes are not it, which is what keeps a correct reader from
paying for a case almost nothing exercises.

**The shape of the interface is `PkgHost`'s, and for the same reason.**
`zip.cpp` is compiled *into* `tests.wasm`, where a syscall is a link error by
design (Testing.md), so the bytes have to arrive through something abstract. It
is the trick `trust.cpp` and `index.cpp` already use, applied once more.

**The central directory stays resident, and that is deliberate.** It is small,
and it is what a `ZipEntry::name` views — so `DbFile`, `local.cpp` and the
`§8.1` record keep their `Str`s and needed no edit at all. `ZipEntry` loses its
`data` view and gains the offset and length it was derived from; `ZipDir` holds
the directory and the entries together so the lifetime is one object's.

**What this buys, and what it does not.** `unzip -l` and `unzip one-entry` stop
holding the archive, so one larger than the sixteen megabytes a process gets is
now readable. `/bin/pkg` gains nothing: `acquire` hashes the whole archive and
`local_load` caps it at `PACKAGE_MAX` before reading, so it is resident either
way — it passes a `MemZipSource` over what it already has. Deflated entries gain
nothing either, since `Sys::Inflate` stages its input and the packed bytes must
be in memory to be handed over. And `tools/pack.py` always deflates, so the
stored path this makes cheap is exercised by the unit suite and by nothing in
the tree. The win is narrow and real; it is not a general reduction in what a
package costs.

`ZipRead` gains `Io`. As a coroutine over a source that can fail, a read error
had nowhere to go but `Malformed`, and calling a working archive malformed
because a descriptor hiccuped would be a lie.

## The repository has an address of its own

`/etc/repositories` moves from `https://pub.sergev.org/braam` to
`https://braamix.github.io`. Nothing in the code or the formats changes: it is
one line of configuration, and the URL never appears in a source file, a test
fixture or a manual — the documents say `https://packages.example/braam` and
`tools/mkrepo.py` says `https://packages.test/braam`, so a real host was
already only ever in this one place.

**The move is a move of hosting, not of trust.** `/etc/anchor` is untouched,
because the keys did not change — only the machine serving what they signed.
What did have to be redone is the index itself: `N` is inside the signed
region and `index.cpp` refuses an index whose `N` disagrees with the line that
fetched it (§7's `header` step, `Err(Perm)`), so the repository was re-issued
under the same index key rather than re-pointed. That check is why a repository
cannot be relocated by a redirect, and moving one is the case it was written
against.

**No client has to be told.** The boot unpack replaces `/etc` wholesale at
every version change (Package_Management.md §6), so a tab that has ever run
this version has the new line; a tab that never opens another version keeps
fetching an address that is no longer answered, and the `pkg -v` trace added in
0.4 is what tells it apart from a repository that is merely down. An upgrade
path for the file was not considered, for the same reason a stale `/share` is
not deleted at boot: the archive is the upgrade path.

Two prose files named the old address by implication rather than by spelling —
README.md said there was no public repository, and `rootfs/README` said a URL
"should be put in" a file that already had one. Both now say where the system
points, which is the only reason the change touches documents at all.

**`/etc/help` goes back to being a list.** The five prose passages explaining
command lookup, package checking, generations and `pkg verify`'s limits are
what the manuals are for; a page reached by typing `help` is worth more when
what is on it is the names and their spellings, and nothing on that page was
the only copy. `test/smoke/subst.mjs` counts three copies of the file as its
many-writes case, so the numbers beside it move with the trim — which is the
comment there saying they would.

**The README's launch button is a file in the tree, not a badge service.**
`https://braamix.github.io` serves the system itself at the root and the
package index beside it, so the same address the repository line names is also
the thing to click. The usual way to put a green button in a README is an
`img.shields.io` URL, which makes a project whose first claim is that nothing
is borrowed fetch its own front door from somebody else's server, and breaks
the day that server does. `doc/launch.svg` is two rectangles, a triangle and
one `<text>`, drawn with presentation attributes because GitHub strips
`<style>` out of an SVG, and naming a font *stack* rather than a font because
the browser rendering it is not this one.

## 0.5 — A system a program can be written for, not only in

`BRAAM_VERSION_BASE` moves to 0.5; the commit count and the hash behind it carry
on unedited. 0.4 was a system that could install software it was not built with
— a repository, an anchor, an index and a transaction, all of it about how a
program *arrives*. 0.5 is about what a program may assume once it is here: a
libm, vendored from musl and checked against a real oracle, so that arithmetic
on a float is no longer a link error; signals delivered through a third export,
so a program can be told something happened without being told it is dead;
`/bin/unzip` for archives that make no claims; and the publisher tools in the
installed SDK, so a package can be built outside this tree by whoever wrote the
program.

**The move is the assertion, not the count.** No single commit between 0.4 and
here forced a new base: a vendored libm, a leaf-call signal export, a
subcommand that lists the index, a boot that says why it went nowhere. Taken one
at a time they are a system being finished. Taken together they change who the
system is for — 0.4's answer to "what can I run here" was "whatever a repository
signs", and 0.5's is "whatever you write, against a floating-point library, a
signal, and an SDK that packages it".

## Signals, and the two facts cancellation was conflating

`sched_cancel` is one sticky `bool` on a `CancelState`, checked at every await
point, and until now it was the only thing `^C` could do. That works, but it
says two things at once that Unix keeps apart: *something happened to you* and
*you are dead*. Three consequences, each of which had been written down as a
deliberate absence and each of which was really the same absence:

- `trap '' 2` was refused outright, because once the flag is set nothing can
  decline it, and `trap … 2` in a **script** could never run at all — the
  script's own process was the thing cancelled.
- A resize reached a program only on its next keystroke. Geometry rides on
  every terminal reply, so `less` handled a resize *perfectly* once a key
  arrived; between the resize and that key the screen was visibly wrong, and a
  shrink could fail the next `ScreenBlit` and exit the pager with status 1.
  `vmstat` had a comment saying it needed a signal to notice, which it did.
- `Error::Cancelled` was unrepresentable on the wire on purpose, so "your
  syscall was interrupted" could not be said.

**The delivery mechanism is a third export, and its whole safety argument is
that it is a leaf call.** `_sig(n)` records the number in a word and returns:
no allocation, no syscall, no coroutine resumed. The alternative considered
first was a parked `Sys::SigWait` that a dedicated task blocks on, which needs
no host change at all — but it burns one of eight task slots, and worse, it
only reaches a process that has *already asked*, so a default disposition
delivered to a process that is merely running has nowhere to land. A third
entry point is more machinery and the right machinery.

What makes a new entry point safe is the contract, not the export. A worker is
single-threaded, so the message carrying a signal is handled between two steps
and never inside one. If `_sig` could allocate, syscall, or resume a coroutine,
it would be doing those things beside a kernel that believes this process is
parked. So it may not, and the rule is written where the export is. Nothing is
lost: a process spinning inside a step was reachable only by `terminate()`
before signals and still is.

**Waking is deliberately not the same act as telling.** `_sig` sets a bit and
starts nothing; the kernel separately abandons the calls the process is parked
on, and each answers the new `Error::Intr`. Both a dying process and an
interrupted one arrive at `serve()` as a cancelled server task, and the two are
told apart by `Proc::dead`, which `~End` sets before it cancels anything. That
one test is the entire difference between "interrupted" and "dead".

**Only five calls may be abandoned** — `Read`, `KeyRead`, `Sleep`, `Wait`,
`ClipRead`. This is `SA_RESTART`'s question, and the answer is a list rather
than a flag because `Err(Intr)` has to mean *nothing happened*: an interrupted
`Write` has lost how many bytes went, which is a worse thing to hand a program
than a wait it did not want. Everything else runs to completion and the process
reads its mask at the next suspension. Interrupting `KeyRead` is not optional:
the kernel-side server parks on `p.keys->next()`, and leaving it there while the
process issued another read would put two receivers on one `Channel`, which is a
kernel invariant a user program must not be able to reach.

**Two dispositions, not three.** Unix has Default / Ignore / Handler; here a bit
set in `Proc::caught` means delivered and a bit clear means the default action
runs. A program that catches a signal and does nothing has ignored it — which
is exactly what `trap '' 2` wanted to say and had no way to. That removes a
whole table and a whole syscall's worth of API surface.

**The mask starts empty**, and that is the property that made this landable.
Every binary in the tree behaves exactly as it did until it opts in: `^C` still
cancels, `WINCH` still does nothing. The three suites passed with the entire
mechanism in place and nothing using it, which is a much stronger check than any
individual assertion.

**A signal travels the channel a reply travels.** `CancelState::waiting` is a
single slot, so the stepper, parked on `p->done.recv()`, cannot also park on a
signal. Rather than give `Waiter` the intrusive queue links a second wait would
need, a signal is pushed into `done` as a record with `sig` set, and the stepper
pops it and posts rather than steps. A full box means the signal is dropped and
the default action stands, which for `SIG_INT` is the old behaviour and the safe
way to fail.

**The mask is a payload because `SIG_WINCH` is bit 28** and the op word's
argument is 24 bits. That was caught by writing the numbers down, not by a test:
Unix's numbering is worth keeping — `128 + n` is already a status here, and
people type `kill -9` — and it does not fit where masks usually go.

**`SIG_WINCH` goes to the foreground**, not only to whoever holds a terminal
route. The first version signalled the two claim holders, which is wrong for
`vmstat`: it writes to stdout and claims nothing, so it would never have been
told. The foreground set is already the answer to "who is the terminal for", and
it is what `^C` uses.

`Sys::Kill` grew a payload rather than an 86th operation, since sending a signal
is what killing already was; an empty payload still means `SIG_KILL`, so nothing
that predates signals changed. `SIG_TSTP` and `SIG_CONT` have numbers and no
sender, and are deliberately **not** in `SIG_CATCHABLE`: a number nothing
delivers is an ABI nothing tests. `^Z` remains a milestone rather than a
command — but the shape it needs is now visible, and it is not the resume-side
twin of `CancelToken` that Shell.md promised it would be. Stopping is the
*stepper* holding off the next step, which suspends no coroutine at an arbitrary
point and needs nothing of every awaitable.

## A libm, and it is not ours

Nothing in Braam could compute a square root. `f64` existed in `kernel/types.h`
and was used for one thing, milliseconds crossing the host boundary; the only
arithmetic on a float anywhere in the tree was four lines of `sched.cpp`
rounding a timer deadline up. `df` and `ps` faked one decimal place with
`(rem * 10) / 1024`. That is the wall a Unix port hits, and because
`--allow-undefined` is deliberately absent (M0) it is a hard wall: `wasm-ld:
error: undefined symbol: sqrt`, and no way forward from there.

**The decision worth writing down is that this code is vendored.** Every other
line in the tree is ours. A libm is the wrong place to start being original:
correctness here is measured in units of the last bit, the algorithms are forty
years of accumulated argument reduction and minimax fitting, and a bug in one is
a wrong answer rather than a crash. The source is musl's, as
wasi-libc/wasix carries it, MIT licensed, with the wasm decisions already made
upstream — `arch/wasm32/fp_arch.h` says the machine has no floating-point
exceptions and no alternate rounding modes, so `fp_barrier` and `fp_force_eval`
are identity functions and `WANT_ROUNDING` is 0.

So `src/math/musl/` is byte-identical to upstream and a re-sync is a clean diff.
Which settles three things that would otherwise be arguments: those sources
compile with `-w` rather than this tree's `-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Werror`, they
carry a `.clang-format` with `DisableFormat`, and they are **C**. The last is
not a preference — 47 of them do not compile as C++, all for the same reason:
`libm.h`'s `asuint64` and `asdouble` are compound-literal unions, which C
rejects nothing about and C++ rejects entirely. Enabling C cost one word in
`project(braam LANGUAGES CXX C)`; the toolchain file already set
`CMAKE_C_COMPILER`, `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT`.

### What was measured before any of it was written

157 of the 163 candidate sources compiled first try against a header shim of
about 150 lines. The six that did not were gaps in the shim — a `weak` macro,
`FP_ILOGB0`, `a_clz_64` — not in musl. The archive that came out had no
undefined symbol at all beyond `__stack_pointer`: no compiler-rt, no libc,
nothing for `--allow-undefined` to have hidden.

The cost, linked with `--gc-sections`, which never extracts an unreferenced
archive member:

| a program that calls | .wasm bytes |
| --- | --- |
| `sqrt` | 309 |
| `fmod` | 864 |
| `atan2` | 1,410 |
| `exp` | 3,149 |
| `log` | 5,261 |
| `sin` and `cos` | 5,340 |
| `pow` | 8,319 |
| `tgamma` | 10,402 |
| twelve transcendentals at once | 23,924 |

`sqrt` is 309 bytes because it is `f64.sqrt` and the member is never pulled.
`rootfs/` did not move at all — no program in `src/cmd/` links this — and
`kernel.wasm` is byte-identical, since the kernel does not link it either.

### long double is not a slow path here, it is a link error

`long double` on wasm32 is 113-bit quad. Every operation on one is a
compiler-rt call — `__addtf3`, `__multf3`, `__trunctfdf2` — and there is no
compiler-rt for this target. So the `l`-suffixed half of `<math.h>` cannot
exist: every `*l.c` is left upstream, and so are `nexttoward.c` and
`nexttowardf.c`, which take a `long double` argument and were the only two
non-`l` files to reach for it.

The private `float.h` in `musl/shim/` declares `LDBL_MANT_DIG` to be
`DBL_MANT_DIG`, which is what steers `libm.h` and both text engines onto their
53-bit paths. Nothing is compiled with a real quad in it.

The `float` half is real single-precision code — `sinf`, `expf`, `powf` with
their own data tables — rather than rounded doubles. Rounding wrappers were the
plan until it turned out musl's kernels cost nothing extra to compile and are
more accurate.

### errno never came up

The question of what a domain error should be in a system whose errors are
`Result<T, E>` had an answer before it was asked: musl's libm does not use
`errno`. `__math_invalid`, `__math_oflow` and `__math_uflow` are pure IEEE
computations — `(x-x)/(x-x)`, a multiply that overflows — and what comes back
is a NaN or an infinity. `math_errhandling` is 0 and there is nothing to
report. A `Result<f64, Error>` return would have been unusable to a port anyway.

### Eight are one instruction, and four that look like it are not

wasm has `f64.sqrt`, `f64.abs`, `f64.floor`, `f64.ceil`, `f64.trunc`,
`f64.nearest` and `f64.copysign`. `src/math/native.c` defines those eight (with
`nearbyint` as `rint`, there being no environment to differ about) over the
builtins, and musl's software versions — including `sqrt_data.c`'s table — are
not vendored. They are *defined* and not merely declared because a caller
reaching one through a pointer, or built with `-fno-builtin`, still needs the
symbol.

`round`, `fmin`, `fmax` and `fma` look like they belong in that list and do
not. `__builtin_round`, `__builtin_fmin`, `__builtin_fmax` and `__builtin_fma`
each emit an undefined symbol on this target — probed, not assumed — so musl's
implementations are load-bearing. `f64.min` and `f64.max` exist but are not
`fmin` and `fmax`: they propagate a NaN where C says to return the other
operand, which the unit suite checks.

### The text half was the only real work

`printf("%f")` blocks more ports than the transcendentals do, and musl's two
engines were not a lift. `src/internal/floatscan.c` and `fmt_fp` inside
`src/stdio/vfprintf.c` are both parameterised on `LDBL_MANT_DIG` and both run
through a `FILE` and the `shgetc` scanner, neither of which exists here. So
`src/math/cvt/` holds them derived rather than verbatim: `long double` becomes
`double`, `frexpl` and the one L-suffixed literal go with it, and the FILE
becomes `cvt.h`'s `Cur`, a cursor over a bounded string, and a `Sink`, a
truncating buffer.

One bug came out of that, and it is worth recording because it was invisible:
`isspace` and `isdigit` were written as macros, and musl calls them as
`isspace((c = shgetc(f)))` — so the macro read the stream **twice per test**,
and the parser was one character behind. `parse_f64("-1")` returned 1.0 and
`parse_f64(".5")` returned 5.0. They are `static inline` functions now, which is
what they are in a real libc, and the comment beside them says why.

What that buys is a correctly-rounded `strtod` and an exact `%f`/`%e`/`%g`, the
same ones every musl program gets. The unit suite checks the three classic
misses — `0.1`, `2.2250738585072011e-308`, `8.98846567431158e307` — which a
digit-at-a-time accumulation gets wrong.

`fmt_f64_shortest` is a search rather than a Ryu implementation: ask `fmt_fp`
for one significant digit, then two, and stop at the first that parses back
bit-for-bit. With an exact engine underneath that is genuinely the shortest
round trip, for a dozen lines. The one subtlety is that `%g` chooses exponent
form below its precision, so `100` at one digit is `1e+02` — correct, and not
what anyone wants — so the final conversion asks for `e + 1` digits when the
plain form exists, and `%g` drops the trailing zeros it does not need.

`df` and `ps` keep their integer-tenth fakes. Converting them would make two
core binaries link a libm for one decimal place each, and their comments already
say the truncation is deliberate.

### The suite has a real oracle, which the others do not

`test/unit/test_math.cpp` is the first case in the tree that can check an answer
against something other than itself: `tools/mkmathdata.py` — hand-run, the
seventh tool in `tools/` — asks the host's own libm through Python and writes
`test/unit/math.data` as raw f64 bits. The budget is two ulp for everything,
which absorbs the oracle's own error as well as ours, and the case prints the
worst it saw.

It sees **15 ulp, in `lgamma`**, and that is the only budget raised. `lgamma`
has zeros at 1 and 2; near one of them the cancellation costs digits that no
implementation gets back, and 15 ulp of a value near −0.12 is not a defect.
`tgamma` gets 4, `sqrt`, `fmod` and `remainder` get 0 because they are exact.
Everything else is within two.

The rest of the case is what a table cannot say: NaN propagation through every
kernel, `±Inf` arguments, `copysign(1, -0.0)` being −1 and `1/(-0.0)` being
−Inf, subnormals through `frexp`/`ldexp`/`nextafter`, `round` being away from
zero where `rint` is to even, and `fma` keeping the low half of a product.

`tests` links `braam_math` rather than compiling its sources in. The compile-in
convention exists so that a syscall in `sh/` or `pkg/` is a link error; this
library links `braam_flags` alone and has no syscall to hide, exactly as
`braam_ui` does not.

### Three libraries in the SDK, for the same reason there were two

`braam_math` joins `braam_proc` and `braam_ui`. The rule that kept the other
four out has not changed — `braam_core`, `braam_fs`, `braam_svc` and
`braam_user` each carry a host import no binary may have — and this one carries
none, which `test/smoke/abi.mjs` still checks over every binary. Only the count
moved.

`src/math/musl/` and `src/math/cvt/` are excluded from the header install, and
that exclusion is not tidiness: those directories answer `<stdint.h>`,
`<float.h>` and `<math.h>` for the vendored sources and define `errno` and the
character classes as they need them. A `stdint.h` under `include/braam/` would
be a trap. The first install put them there, and an out-of-tree build caught it.

## A boot that goes nowhere says so

A black screen was the one failure braam had no words for. Reported against
Microsoft Edge: the page loaded, the title was right, the canvas stayed black,
and nothing appeared in the status line or the console. It was not Edge. A
script-blocking extension in the profile — "Script Defender" — had left
`javascript: block` for `http://*` and `https://*` in the profile's content
settings, with an allow rule for one origin. Chromium applies those from the
stored profile at startup, and it does so **even though the extension itself was
switched off**, which is why the same profile boots on a second launch and not
on a cold one. The document parsed to a DOM, the canvas element existed at its
untouched 300x150 default, and not one line of script ran.

Nothing in braam could report that, because reporting it was itself script. The
whole diagnostic path — `index.html`'s try/catch, `onError`, the status line —
lives below the point where execution had already stopped. So the first of three
guards is a `<noscript>`, the only thing in the page that speaks without
scripting, and it names the cause rather than the symptom: a blocker can hold
scripting off while appearing disabled, which otherwise reads as a browser that
cannot run braam at all.

The other two cover the neighbouring silence, since a stalled fetch throws
nothing and an unresolved promise is indistinguishable from work in progress.
Above the module sits a classic `<script>` — deliberately classic, so it needs
no fetch of its own and runs when the module's never arrives — holding a five
second watchdog that the module disarms on entry. After that `mount` owns the
question, and the worker now names each boot step it starts (`kind: "stage"`,
recorded and shown only if the watchdog fires) so the message is "stuck fetching
kernel.wasm" rather than "stuck". The stages are messages the page never
displays in the ordinary case, which is the point: the cost of a boot that works
is three postMessages.

Five seconds is long enough that a slow network does not trip it and short
enough to beat the reflex to reload. A watchdog that fires on a merely slow page
teaches people to ignore it; every condition here is permanent rather than slow,
so the fetch is not late, it is never coming.

## `pkg list` lists the repository, and `-i` what is installed

The index was reachable only through `pkg search <pattern>`: a person who wanted
to know what a repository offers had to invent a pattern for it, and `pkg search
'*'` is not something anyone guesses. Meanwhile `pkg list` printed the installed
set — the one listing that is also `ls /pkg/gen/<N>` away, and the one a person
asks for second, after deciding what to install.

So the default is flipped. `pkg list` prints the stored index in `pkg search`'s
three columns, and `pkg list -i` prints what `pkg list` used to. That is a
change of meaning for an existing command rather than an addition, which is
worth stating plainly: a script that ran `pkg list` for the installed set now
gets the repository. The flag is the whole of the migration, and it is the
letter apk and dpkg both spell `-i` for the same question.

The listing deliberately does **not** mark rows that are already installed. It
would need the active generation as well as the index, so the command would
start failing in situations where only one of the two is readable, and `pkg
info` already answers "is this installed" for a name, with an `installed` row
that a listing has no room for.

### The two callers are one function

`pkg search` and the new listing differ by a predicate, so the index is loaded,
filtered and printed by one coroutine that takes `all` — column widths still
come off the rows actually printed, and a stanza with no description still ends
its row at the version. The installed path keeps its own coroutine rather than
becoming a branch of `pkg_list`: one frame would then hold a `CheckedIndex`
pointer *and* the generation's two `String`s, and §2's 512-byte frame rule is
not a suggestion.

### An option after a command word belongs to the command

`take_flags` rejected any word beginning `-` that was not `-v`, `--verbose`,
`-h` or `--help`, wherever it appeared, so `pkg list -i` would have died as
`pkg: unknown option: -i` before `pkg_list` ran. It now rejects only what stands
*before* the command word; after it, an unrecognised flag is passed through as
that command's argv, which is how `-i` reaches `pkg list` and how any later
subcommand option will reach its own. `-v` is still taken wherever it is typed —
`pkg -v list -i` and `pkg list -i -v` are one thing — and `pkg -x update` still
says `unknown option: -x`, because `-x` is in front. What changed is the message
for a flag *behind* the command: `pkg update -x` now fails through `update`'s
own operand check, its usage line and 2, rather than pkg's. Same status, better
address.

The flag itself is parsed by `OptParse`, the parser `ls`, `mkdir` and `mv`
already use, rather than a hand-written comparison — `pkg list -i` is the first
pkg subcommand with an option of its own and will not be the last.

## Two ways to name a package, and `/bin/unzip`

`pkg install` took package names, and every name had to be in a signed index.
Nothing in the system could open a zip at all: `curl` could fetch one and there
it stopped. So a person who had an archive — built themselves, handed to them,
sitting on a mirror — had no way in, in a system whose whole point is that the
person at the keyboard owns the machine.

The obvious objection is that Package_Management.md §7 said *"nothing is
unzipped, written to the store, or run before its digest matches a digest from a
signed index"*, and closed with *"there is no `--force`, `--insecure` or
`--no-verify` in any form"*. Taking a path as an operand is that flag, spelled
worse — silently, with nothing on the command line saying so.

What resolves it is noticing what §7 actually protects against. §3's attacker is
**the repository and the network in front of it** — never the operator. And §11
already said `pkg` has no privileges to have: OPFS keeps no mode, `/bin` is
writable, *"anything may overwrite `/bin/pkg` itself"*. So the guarantee was
never "only checked code runs"; it was **"a repository never chooses the
bytes"**, and a sideload does not touch that. §11's headline is reworded to say
so, because the old phrasing — "`pkg` installs only what it checked" — invited
exactly the confusion that made this look like a weakening.

So there are now two ways to name bytes and only two: a digest in a signed
index, or a path or URL a person typed. §7's rule is restated over both, and the
first is untouched — there is still no way to make a package the index named
skip a step.

### What keeps the first way intact

Two rules, and they are the whole of why this is safe to add.

**The index owns every name-version it lists.** An archive whose `.PKGINFO`
calls itself `hello-1.0-r0` at bytes the index did not give is refused at step
`index`. Without this a path could quietly stand in for a repository's package,
which is §3's *wrong package* attack wearing a local disguise. It is the one
refusal in the smoke case with a comment saying it is the one that matters.

**Identity is the digest, not the operand.** `solve()` already keyed packages by
digest, so the sideload's stanza is simply appended to the solver's universe and
an archive the index *does* list collapses into the index's entry with no code
at all. That gives the offline case for free: a package carried in on a file or
fetched from a mirror is checked exactly as §7 checks one, keeps its `G`, and
skips only the download. `acquire()` looks up the held archive by digest for the
same reason, so the two cases are one branch.

### The bug this found

`package_read` checked only that `P` and `V` were non-empty, and §6 said in so
many words that *"a name is any token"* — while `pkg_stem` built
`/pkg/store/<P>-<V>/` and `/pkg/db/<P>-<V>` out of them. A `.PKGINFO` saying
`P: ../../bin` would have written outside the store. Nobody had to care before:
`P` arrived from a signed index, and a publisher who corrupts their own store is
their own problem. Making `.PKGINFO` the stanza turns it into untrusted input to
a path, so `stanza_component` now holds `P` and `V` to a path component — no
`/`, no `\`, no `..`, no control byte.

It is applied in `package_read` rather than at the sideload's call site, so the
index's own stanzas meet it too. That is stricter than §3.2 was, and §3.2 and §6
are amended to say so. No legitimate name is affected, and a publisher whose
tooling emits a `P` with a slash in it now finds out at the client instead of
after it has scattered files across `/pkg`.

### The smaller decisions

**`G: 0`** is §8.1's record of "nothing vouched". It is chosen on the *digest*,
not on how the archive arrived, which is what makes the offline case above
record a real `G`. `pkg verify` reports such a record as `unvouched` and
deliberately does **not** fail over it — it is how the package arrived, not
something that went wrong, and a deliberate sideload must not leave `pkg verify`
permanently red. `pkg info` gained a `vouched` row and a fallback to the `/pkg/db` record,
without which a sideloaded package would have been invisible to it: `info` asks
the index, and the index has never heard of one.

**§6.1's `cmd:` names are derived from the archive's flat `bin/`.** The index
gets them from `mkindex.py`, and §6.1 says outright that `.PKGINFO` need carry
none — so a sideload with no derivation would silently lose every `cmd:` name,
and §6.1's invariant that a solve against the installed set sees what a solve
against the index saw would quietly stop holding. `pkg` computes them itself
from the same rule.

**Scripts run.** §11 used to say a signature authorises execution. Refusing to
run a sideload's `.post-install` would be theatre: the payload lands in
`/pkg/bin` and on `PATH` regardless, so the archive runs code the moment
anything invokes it. What authorises execution is now whatever named the bytes —
a signature for a repository's package, a typed path for a sideload.

**The operand syntax is `://` for a URL and a trailing `.zip` for a file.** Both
were usage errors before, so nothing changes meaning. The alternative — treating
anything `dep_parse` calls malformed as a path — would turn a mistyped package
name into a silent file lookup instead of a clear usage error. The subcommand
table still reads `install <package>...`: a file and a URL are ways of *naming*
a package, and spelling all three there widened the aligned description column
past sixty and wrapped every row on the terminal.

### `/bin/unzip`

The other half, and the one that needs no policy argument at all. The zip reader
already existed as `src/cmd/pkg/zip.cpp` and `unzip.cpp`, already checked
against `web/fs.js` over the same bytes by the unit suite. `/bin/unzip` names
those two sources outright rather than linking `braam_pkg`, exactly as
`/bin/test` names the shell's `cond.cpp` instead of dragging in the whole shell.

It exists **separately** on purpose. Arbitrary archives belong to a tool that
makes no claims, so that `pkg` keeps a narrow guarantee it can actually make. It
also inherits §5.2's path rules — an absolute, backslashed or climbing name is
refused by the parser before extraction sees it — so it has no path check of its
own, which is the good kind of not-writing-code.

## 0.4 — A system that can install software it was not built with

`BRAAM_VERSION_BASE` moves to 0.4; the commit count and the hash behind it carry
on unedited. 0.3 was a shell grown into a language over a filesystem that
answered about what it held — everything it could run, it had been built with.
0.4 adds the other half: `/bin/pkg`, twelve subcommands over signed
repositories, an Ed25519 anchor, an index whose command names the publisher
never writes down, a dependency solver, and a transaction that rolls back. A
store the system did not compile is now a place software arrives from.

**The move is the assertion, not the count.** Nothing between 0.3 and here forced
a new base: the commits are a package format frozen before a parser existed, a
verifier passed in rather than reached for, five stanza files read by one reader,
and the four commands that finished the set. Taken one at a time they are a
program being written. Taken together they change what the system *is* — 0.3's
answer to "where does a new program come from" was "the tree it was built from",
and 0.4's is "a repository, if it is signed by something the anchor names".

## 0.3 — A shell with a language, and files with names of their own

`BRAAM_VERSION_BASE` moves to 0.3; the commit count and the hash behind it carry
on unedited. The base is the only number anyone chooses, and it moves when what
the system *is* has changed rather than when enough commits have piled up. 0.2
was one program model and a shell that had become an ordinary process. 0.3 is
that shell grown into a language — variables, command substitution, globbing,
functions, `if`, `while`, `until`, `for`, `case`, and a file run by `#!` — over
a filesystem that now answers about what it holds: modification times, symbolic
links, a rename, and `PATH` searched by the kernel rather than by whoever asked.

**Nothing in the numbering forces the move**, which is why it is written down. A
commit count cannot say that the shell stopped reading commands and started
interpreting them, and a hash says less than that. The base is the one place a
difference in kind can be asserted, and 0.2 → 0.3 is that assertion: a script
written against 0.2's shell was a list of commands, and one written against
0.3's may be a program.

## Three files that were living in the wrong place

`/version` is now `/etc/version`, `/etc/pkg/anchor` is `/etc/anchor`, and
`/pkg/repositories` is `/etc/repositories`. The previous commit argued that
`/etc` is where this system's shipped configuration goes; these three were left
outside it, each for a different bad reason, and moving them makes `/` one name
shorter, `/etc` a flat directory of five files, and `/pkg` entirely
machine-owned.

**The stamp was at the root because nothing else was there yet.** `/version` is
one line the host writes at the end of an unpack and boot reads before the
shell. It is not something a user opens, and the root is the first thing anyone
types `ls` on. Two characters of a top-level namespace is a high price for a
file that exists to be compared against a constant.

**Moving it changes what an interrupted unpack leaves behind, for the better.**
`installOps` removes each top-level directory the archive carries before
rewriting it, and writes the stamp last. At the root, the stamp was outside
everything the unpack touched, so an unpack that died halfway left the *old*
version string standing over a half-written `/bin` — and the next boot read a
mismatch, printed `the stored image is X and this kernel is Y`, and offered a
choice. Declining kept an image that was not any version at all. Inside `/etc`
the stamp is removed with everything else and rewritten only if the unpack
finishes, so a half-written image leaves no stamp, and `unpack_if_stale` reads
an absent stamp as an empty store and finishes the job without asking. The
prompt now appears only where it means something: a complete image of a
different version. This was a consequence of the move rather than its motive,
and it is the sort of thing worth noticing before shipping rather than after.

**`/etc/pkg/` was a directory holding one file.** The anchor is the only thing
that was ever going to be in it. The extra component was there because the path
was written when `pkg` looked like it would bring several files with it, and it
did — but they went to `/pkg`, where the state belongs, and the one file left
behind kept a directory to itself. `/etc/anchor` says the same thing in four
fewer characters and one fewer `ls`.

**The repository list was in the store because that is where `pkg` writes.**
`/pkg` is deliberately the directory the archive does not carry, so that an
installed program survives a release (Package_Management.md §11). That argument
is about `pkg`'s *record* — the store, the database, the generations — which
can only be rebuilt by reinstalling and re-checking. It was never an argument
about the one line naming where to fetch from. That line is configuration: a
human types it, nothing accumulates in it, and it sits beside the anchor it is
checked against.

**So the URL is now re-pinned by a release, and that is the point rather than
the cost.** `/etc` is replaced wholesale at every version change, which is the
property §6 relies on for the anchor: it cannot be poisoned in the store for
good. The repository URL and the keys that vouch for its index are two halves
of one decision, and having a release restore one but not the other was the odd
arrangement. A user who points the system somewhere else has made an edit a
version change undoes — the same bargain as a locally trusted key, and §11
already documents it. What is gained is that `rootfs/etc/repositories` ships a
working URL, so `pkg update` needs no seeding on a fresh store, and a publisher
building their own braam sets it in the same step as the anchor.

**The tests moved with the paths, and two numbers moved with them.**
`test/unit/test_zip.cpp` compares the archive entry for entry against
`web/fs.js`'s reading of the same bytes and asserts the count: 44 became 45,
because `etc/repositories` is a new entry. `test/smoke/subst.mjs` asserts what
`wc` prints over three copies of `/etc/help`, so editing that document moved
`25548` to `25884` — the same hostage the previous commit collected, and the
comment beside it still says so. `ls /etc` stopped fitting on one row: five
names in columns down the grid rather than three across it, so the case now
compares a sorted set of names instead of an exact row, and the check that a
directory prints a trailing slash moved to `ls /`, which still has some.

## The directory was never shared with anybody

`/share` is now `/etc`. It is one of the two top-level directories `rootfs.zip`
carries, and it holds three things: `help`, which is the whole of `/bin/help`;
`motd`, which boot prints; and `pkg/anchor`, the root keys every repository
index is checked against. The name was borrowed from `/usr/share`, and on a
Unix that name means something precise — data a package installs that is
independent of the architecture, so that several architectures may *share* one
copy of it. None of that is true here. There is one architecture, wasm32; there
is no `/usr` to hang it under (§5.1 says why); and nothing shares anything,
because there is one store and one system in it. What is actually in the
directory is this system's shipped configuration and its one document, which is
what `/etc` has always meant.

**The shorter name is worth two characters six times over.** `rootfs/etc/help`
is written to 78 columns and read through `less` on an 80-column grid, and four
of its lines carried the old path. `/etc/pkg/anchor` also lets the `More` table
at the end of that document keep its column while the entries under it get
narrower. The document lost eight bytes, which is visible: `test/smoke/subst.mjs`
concatenates three copies of it and asserts what `wc` prints, so `25572` became
`25548`. That case is not about the help text at all — it is about a pipe with
eight slots and a drain that has to be running before the wait — and the number
is a hostage to a file it never mentions. It has been one since the case was
written and the comment beside it says so; renaming a directory is just the
first thing that ever collected.

**Two other `share`s in the tree are deliberately untouched.** The SDK installs
into `share/braam/examples` and `share/doc/braam` on the developer's real
machine, where `/usr/local/share` means exactly what it says on a Unix and this
rename has no jurisdiction. And a *package* may carry a `share/` subtree of its
own — `/pkg/store/<stem>/share/…`, which Package_Formats.md §10's tutorial writes
and the `g:` trigger globs in `test/unit/repo.data` match against. That is the
publisher's layout inside their own zip, not ours; a package built for this
system is free to call its data directory whatever a package on any other system
would. Renaming it would also have meant regenerating a signed fixture to say
nothing new.

**A store written before this commit keeps a `/share` nobody deletes.** The
unpack in `web/fs.js` removes each top-level directory *the archive carries*
before rewriting it, which is the property Package_Management.md §6 leans on —
the anchor cannot be poisoned in the store for good, because every version
change re-pins it. The same rule is why a directory the archive stops carrying
is never removed: `installOps` derives its removal list from the entries, and
there are no `share/` entries any more. An upgraded store therefore shows both
`/etc` and a stale `/share` in `ls /` until someone types `rm -r /share`. Adding
a hardcoded removal to boot was considered and dropped: it would be a line
naming a directory that has no other reason to exist in the source, kept for
ever against a case that stops occurring after one boot, and the alternative is
a command the user can already type. There is no upgrade machinery here and
adding one for a rename would be the wrong first customer for it.

## What the tab asked for, and what came back

A repository that would not answer gave three lines and no way to tell which of
several things had gone wrong:

```
$ pkg update
https://pub.sergev.org/braam
pkg: fetch: permission denied
```

Everything the browser knew was thrown away before it reached the screen.
`fetch_url` hands a process a `Fetched{ status, headers, body }`, `ProcHost::
open` kept the status and dropped the headers, and `fetch_capped` turns every
non-200 into `Error::NotFound` — so a 403, a 404 and a directory listing all
read alike, and a refusal by the browser reads as none of them. `pkg -v` prints
the two sides curl prints: `> GET <url>`, then `< <status>`, the response
headers a line each, and the body's size as it was counted off the wire.

**The trace lives in `ProcHost`, not in `update`.** Every fetch this program
makes — the index, and every package `install` and `upgrade` download — goes
through the three `PkgHost` methods `open`, `read` and `close`, so tracing them
there covers all of it and duplicates nothing. It also keeps the printing out of
`index.cpp` and `trust.cpp`, which compile into `tests.wasm` and may not make a
syscall; `host.cpp` is already the file that stays out. `PkgHost` did not have
to grow a parameter for the headers, because the layer that *drops* them is the
same layer that now prints them.

**Both lists are shorter than curl's, and that is the browser's doing.** A page
cannot see the request headers it sent — `fetch` composes them and reports
nothing back — so `> GET <url>` is the whole request, and it is honest: those
are the only headers `pkg` asks for. A cross-origin response exposes only the
CORS-safelisted headers to script, so `<` prints what the browser allowed
through rather than what the server sent. Saying so in `/share/help` costs two
sentences and saves a publisher an afternoon.

**Two hints that should not need a flag.** `curl` has said for some time that
`Err(Perm)` means *"the server did not grant cross-origin access"* and
`Err(Io)` means *"no answer"*; `pkg` printed neither, though it is the program
whose whole job is talking to a server somebody else configured. It prints them
now, unconditionally, in curl's words — a diagnostic nobody thinks to turn on
is a diagnostic nobody reads. The claim is earned rather than guessed:
`web/svc.js` reaches `E.PERM` only through a deliberate `mode: "no-cors"` retry
that the origin answered.

**Gated on the step, not on the error.** The first cut printed the cross-origin
sentence whenever a `Perm` surfaced, and the smoke suite caught it at once: a
package whose bytes do not match its recorded digest is `Perm` as well, and
telling that publisher about CORS would be a confident lie. So `pkg_net_hint`
takes the `IndexStep` and says nothing unless it is one of the two that reach
the network, `Fetch` or `Package`.

**`-v` is `pkg`'s, wherever it is typed.** `OptParse` stops at the first
operand by design, which would have accepted `pkg -v update` and rejected `pkg
update -v` — the spelling actually typed in the report. So `pkg_run` walks the
words once and filters the flag out, and what is left is the command's own
argv, unchanged operand checks and all. The same pass gives `pkg` the message
it was missing for a mistyped flag: `pkg -x` was `unknown command: -x` and is
now `unknown option: -x`. Nothing is lost to the filter, because a §6 token
cannot begin with `-`.

The fake service can model a status, a header block, a CORS refusal and a dead
network, so the smoke suite asserts all four through a pipe — `grep` rather
than the grid, since the trace is wider than sixty columns. What it cannot
model is a redirect: its routes are a `Map` with no `Location`. The real
repository in the report serves a 308, so that part of the story is still only
reachable with a browser.

## A table that says what its rows are for

`pkg` with no command printed its own name and then eleven more, run together
on one wrapped line. Every one of them was true and none of them was any use:
`files` and `list` and `verify` are not words that say what they do to a store,
and nothing in the line said which of them take an operand or what an operand
is. The descriptions existed — `/share/help`'s `Packages` section has had one
per command since each landed — but they are a page in another program, reached
by knowing that `help` exists, and the moment somebody needs them is the moment
they typed `pkg` and got told off.

**So the descriptions move into the table, which reverses a decision made when
the table was written.** The old comment said what each command is for belongs
to `/share/help` and not to a string in the binary, and the fear behind it was
two lists drifting apart. That fear was right about lists and wrong about
fields: `args` and `help` are columns of the same row as `run`, so a command
cannot be added without them, and there is no second array to forget. What
`/share/help` keeps is what it was always better at — the prose around the
commands, the store, the anchor, and what a generation is — and the binary
keeps the one line each that a mistake needs answered.

**The rows are printed in `/share/help`'s order rather than the alphabet.**
`update`, then the two that ask, then the four that change the store, then the
three that report, then `clean`: that is the order somebody meets them in, and
it is the order the manual already uses, so the two lists can be compared by
eye. Nothing depended on the sorting — `find()` is a linear scan over twelve
rows — and the "explicit" half of the old comment, which is about
`--gc-sections` never extracting an unreferenced archive member, is untouched.

**The column width is computed from the table, not written down.** A row whose
name and operands are longer than `install <package>...` moves every
description right; a shorter one costs nothing. This is the same reason the old
code built its line from the table rather than holding a second string, kept
through a change of shape.

**The block is written a row at a time.** It is around seven hundred bytes,
which is past what a coroutine frame may hold — a frame over 512 bytes costs a
whole 64 KiB span — and the alternative, a heap `String` the way `pkg list`
builds its output, would put an allocation failure on the path whose entire job
is to report a mistake. Twelve writes of a `Buf<96>` cost twelve syscalls,
which is twelve more than before and only ever on a path where somebody is
already reading the screen. The loop stops at the first write that fails, so a
`pkg | head -n 1` that closes the pipe ends the block rather than fighting it.

**`help` is a row, and `-h` and `--help` are that row's other spellings.** A
program that lists its commands should list the one that does the listing, and
a row is the only way it stays listed. The two flags are handled by rewriting
the first word before the table is searched, not by an `Opts` parse: `pkg` has
no options and this does not give it any — the first word is a command, and
these are two more ways of writing one of them. Being asked is not a mistake,
so all four of them — `pkg help`, `-h`, `--help`, and `pkg` with nothing after
it — print to stdout and exit 0. **A bare `pkg` is the fourth spelling of
asking, not a usage error.** Typing a program's name and nothing else is how
somebody finds out what it does; there is no wrong argument to report, nothing
was refused, and a shell script that would like the list can have it down a
pipe. What stays a mistake is a word the table does not carry, which prints
`unknown command` and the block on stderr and exits 2.

**`Usage:` is a heading now, and `pkg` alone in the tree capitalises it.** The
block has two of them — `Usage:` over the command line, `Commands:` over the
rows — because it is a page rather than a sentence, and a page wants headings
its eye can find. The eleven single-line usages the subcommands print followed:
`Usage: pkg install <package>...` and the ten beside it, so that whichever of
the twelve messages a mistake produces, it is recognisably the same program
talking. Every other program in `/bin` still prints a lowercase `usage:`, which
is the older and more Unix spelling, and the divergence is deliberate rather
than a migration half-done — `pkg` is the one program here with a surface big
enough to need a table of contents. What it cost is one sentence in
`/share/help`, which quoted `usage: …` as what a usage error prints and now
says what it prints instead of spelling it, since the two spellings differ.

**The smoke case had to stop reading the screen.** The block is fifteen lines
on a sixteen-row grid, so the usage line and the first commands have scrolled
off by the time the prompt is back, and an assertion on what is visible would
have been an assertion about the grid. The case now pipes — `head -n 2` for the
command line under the `Usage:` heading, `grep "install <package>"` for a row in
full — and reads the status from the unpiped form, since a pipeline's status is
its last stage's. That is length-independent, which the old assertion was not:
it named `autoremove` as the first command, and the order has just changed.

`subst.mjs`'s byte counts moved too, because they are three copies of
`/share/help` and it gained two commands' worth of lines. They are meant to
move; the comment beside them says so.

## Four documents, and the one sentence that was wrong in three of them

P28, and the end of `src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md` — which is deleted with it, the plan
having run from P1 to P28. What P28 asked for was `rootfs/README` and
`rootfs/share/help`; what auditing the four documents found was worth more than
what it wrote.

**The two user-facing documents had drifted in opposite directions.**
`rootfs/share/help` was current — a `Packages` section with all eleven
subcommands, written as each landed, and its two checked lists naming every one
of the forty `/bin` entries and all twenty-six builtins. `rootfs/README` was
untouched since before `pkg` existed and said *"Nothing is sent anywhere unless
you ask for it. **Two commands** do"*, which three now do. The difference is
that help has a test and README has almost none: `test/smoke/help.mjs` fails on
a builtin or a binary that is not named, in both directions, so help cannot go
stale in the one way anybody checked. Nothing checks whether a sentence is true.

**One wrong sentence had been copied into three files.** `README.md`,
`rootfs/share/help` and `CLAUDE.md` all said that `test`, `[`, `:`, `echo`,
`true` and `false` keep a file in `/bin` because their whole cost is the spawn.
Four of them do. `[` and `:` are punctuation nothing spawns and have never been
in `BRAAM_BIN_LIST`. The claim is right about *why* — a builtin shadows the name
at a prompt and not everywhere — and wrong about *which*, and it propagated
because each document was written by reading the last one.

**`README.md`'s filesystem paragraph was wrong three times in five lines.** It
said `/` lives in memory (it is `OpfsFs`), that `/home` is the only place files
survive a reload (everything does but `/tmp`), and that without OPFS the system
boots with memory only and says so — it says so and *stops*, since there is
nowhere to run. All three predate the package manager. A front page is the
document nobody re-reads while working, which is exactly why it rots.

**Two specifications still called `/bin/pkg` unbuilt.** Concept.md in two
places, and Package_Management.md in a bolded opening line. The rule is that the
spec is amended in the same commit as the code, and P26 and P27 both missed
these. Package_Management.md's line was worth keeping in substance rather than
deleting: that the policy was written before the code is the interesting fact
about it, and the sentence now says that instead of saying the code is absent.

**A `wc` in an unrelated test is what makes help's length somebody's problem.**
`test/smoke/subst.mjs` reads three concatenated copies of `/share/help` through
a command substitution and asserts `wc` over the result, because the size is
what makes it a many-writes case — forty-six chunks against an eight-slot pipe,
which hangs rather than fails without drain-before-wait. So editing the document
moves three numbers in a test about pipes, and it also outgrew the 120-row grid
`test/smoke/term.mjs` pages it on. Both are real couplings and both are
commented where they bite; a test that generated its own long file instead would
lose the property that the file is one a person maintains.

## One session, told in thirty-nine cases

`test/run.mjs` had reached 4,651 lines: 535 assertions driven through 427 shell
submissions, all inside a single `if (mode === "--kernel")` block 4,380 lines
long at one indent level, with no inner functions. Nothing else in the tree is
close — `test/unit/test_vfs.cpp` is 693 lines and nothing in `web/` passes 631 —
and the C++ suite sitting beside it had been 47 topic files behind one ordered
call list in `main.cpp` since M0. The smoke suite now has the same shape:
`run.mjs` is the `CASES` table and nothing else, `test/smoke/harness.mjs` owns
the kernel, the grid and the tracked cwd, and thirty-nine topic files hold the
assertions. [Testing.md](Testing.md) is the document that was missing with it.

**The obvious split is the wrong one.** A file per topic suggests a CTest case
per topic, and cost is no argument against it: the whole suite runs in under a
second, no real workers are spawned, and a fresh boot costs about 150 ms. The
argument against it is that *the suite is one cumulative session, and that is
the point of it*. A shell that has been running for four thousand keystrokes is
the thing under test. `/home/notes` is written two thousand lines before
`persist` reads it back; `pkg-install` leaves `/pkg` broken on purpose because
`pkg-remove` starts from that; `store.unpacks` is asserted as an absolute
running total at four different moments; `respawn` needs its blocks a second
apart or the kernel's own crash-loop guard fires. Isolating the cases would mean
rewriting the assertions rather than moving them, and would delete the coverage
that comes from long-lived state. So: many files, one process, one boot, one
list that fixes the order — and the order's dependencies written down beside the
entries, the way `test/unit/main.cpp` has always written them down.

`--upto=<case>` is named for what it does rather than for what would be nicer.
It is a prefix, not a filter, because by the paragraph above there is no state
from which a single case could start. It earns its place anyway: iterating on
one case without the output of the thirty after it.

**The move had to be provably behaviour-preserving**, and 67 lines of boot log
was too weak a signal for relocating 4,400 lines. The check used while it was
done was a temporary hook in `submit` that printed each command, its timestamp
and a digest of the resulting screen — 1,430 lines of fingerprint, deterministic
across runs once the boot banner's elapsed microseconds are stripped. Every step
was made to reproduce it exactly. The only deliberate divergence was four clock
cursors: `vt` and `gt` were each one running variable spanning several of the
new files, and the four chunks downstream of `gt` were re-based into the gap it
never reached. Nothing else about those cases changed, and the final output is
byte-identical to the output before the split.

The nine near-identical `*shows` helpers — `gshows`, `cshows`, `fshows`,
`tshows`, `rshows`, `sshows`, `ishows` were byte-identical bar the clock — are
one `shows(base, step)` factory in the harness. That is the only code that
changed rather than moved, and it is why the total is 5,185 lines across 42
files where a pure cut would have been longer.

## Nine attacks, and the two that had nowhere to be refused

P27, the end of Phase G. §3's table has been true since it was written and
mostly tested since P15; what this adds is the three cases that were not, and a
sentence about the four that read alike.

**Two fixtures had been sitting unused since the day they were made.**
`index.data`'s `@stranger` — an index signed by a key the anchor does not name —
and the whole of `anchor.data`, which `run.mjs` had never opened. The C suite
reads both, and what it proves there is that the *function* refuses. What only
`run.mjs` can prove is that the refusal reaches a person: that `pkg update`
prints it, exits 1, and records nothing. Those are different claims, and P27 is
the one that wanted the second.

**The counting rule is proven by a pair, not by a case.** `@repeat` meets
`H:root 2` with one key's signature written twice. On its own, a test that it is
refused proves only that *some* anchor with two `Y:` lines is refused — the file
is unfamiliar in several ways at once. `@short` is one signature under the same
threshold, and `@extra` is three signatures of which two count: that one is
*accepted*, and the refusal moves on to `pkg: signature:` because `anchor.data`
holds no key that signed `index.data`'s index. Three runs, three different
outcomes, and the difference between them is where the rule lives. Swapping
`@repeat` for `@extra` moves the message from `anchor:` to `signature:`, which
is the check that the case is load-bearing.

**Four of the nine attacks print the same line, and that is not a defect.**
`trust_meet` returns a bare bool, so a wrong signature, a key the anchor does
not name, a repeated signature and no signature at all are all
`pkg: signature: permission denied`. §7 step 4 is one check; the step name is
what says which check failed, and it does. Telling an attacker which way a
forgery failed buys nothing, and a reason code would be a second thing to keep
true. What keeps the tests honest is the pairing above rather than the wording.

**A dying tab needed a request that never happens.** `store.defer` was the
nearest thing and is the wrong shape: it performs the operation and withholds
the *reply*, so a deferred rename still renames. `store.stall` is the other
half — a predicate consulted before `perform`, so the matching request is
neither performed nor answered. Stall the rename of `/pkg/active.new`, then
throw the kernel away with `reopen()` and `instantiate()`, and the store is left
exactly as a tab that died there leaves it. It is ten lines, and it is the only
way to test the one step §8.3 calls the commit.

**What the dead tab leaves is a working generation, and `pkg clean` keeps it.**
The rename is the last operation, so everything above it — the store
directories, the records, `/pkg/world`, the generation directory and its whole
link farm — had already been written. After the reload nothing names it, so
nothing is installed and `hi` is `not found`; the retry then builds generation
*2*, because numbering runs past what is on disk rather than reusing a number.
`pkg clean` then keeps generation 1: it is the highest below the active one,
which is what a rollback swings back to, and nothing can distinguish a
generation abandoned mid-commit from one that was superseded. That is the right
answer rather than a missed collection, and the test proves it by swinging
`/pkg/active` back and running the command out of it. §8.3's "rolling back is
swinging the link back" now has a case where the thing rolled back to was never
committed in the first place.

## An anchor somebody can sign again

The rest of P26, and the end of it. `rootfs/share/pkg/anchor` names four keys
that exist: three root, two of them needed, and one index key, signed on a
machine this tree has never seen. The placeholder P13 shipped is gone with the
private halves it never had.

**`G:2`, and no chain leads to it.** §4's walk adopts an anchor when a threshold
of the *previous* anchor's roots signed it, and the previous anchor's roots were
destroyed the day it was made — so nothing can sign the step from 1 to 2. That
is not a gap: §6 says the anchor is re-pinned from `rootfs.zip` wholesale at
every version change, so replacing it *is* cutting a release, which is what §10
of Package_Management.md calls the out-of-band path and what it says the worst
case costs. The number still had to rise, because a client that walks anchors
compares `G` and nothing else orders them.

**Nothing about the build changed.** The anchor is a file in `rootfs/`, copied
by `copy_directory` and packed by `pack.py` like the other four, and no build
step reads a key or signs anything — `pip3 install cryptography` remains a
publisher's problem and not a builder's. Swapping the file was a swap.

**The expiry is 2029-01-01, and `run.mjs` is still the only thing watching it.**
Two years and a bit, which §9 asks be a period somebody can actually keep. The
smoke test reads the archive's `E:` against a real clock and fails the build
once it passes; every other test carries its own clock so that the fixtures do
not rot. It is a build-time alarm for a run-time expiry, and it is now armed
over a date somebody can act on.

## A name the publisher does not get to write down

P26 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), less the anchor. §6.1 of
Package_Formats.md had been true since it was written and produced by nothing:
`tools/mkindex.py` read `.PKGINFO` and copied `p:` through, and the fixture
made up the difference with a hand-written `p:cmd:hi`.

**The derivation belongs to the publisher, not to `pkg` and not to `mkpkg`.**
Three places could compute a `cmd:` name. `pkg` is wrong because the index
stanza is what `/pkg/db` is written from (§8.1), so a name derived at install
time would exist in a solve against the index and not in one against the
installed set. `mkpkg` is wrong because `.PKGINFO` is the package's own claim
about itself, and §6.1's whole point is that a package *cannot get these
wrong*. `mkindex` opens every zip already, to hash it; the directory it needs
is beside the entry it was reading.

**A hand-written `p:` merges rather than losing.** `p` is one §6 list and §1
makes a repeated lowercase letter malformed, so the merge is a join, not a
second line — the declared value first, the derived names sorted after it. The
tool's field dictionary is one entry per letter, and that is the one place it
had to stop being one.

**An entry that cannot be written as a dependency token stops the index.** A
`bin/` name carrying a space or one of `< > = ~` would produce a `p:` line that
§6's reader splits somewhere else, and a silently wrong provide is worse than a
package that will not publish. It is the same refusal a `.PKGINFO` with no `P`
already gets.

**Dropping `p:cmd:hi` from the fixture is what made the test possible.** It was
unversioned, and §6.1's version clause is exactly that an unversioned provide
is never selected on its own — `is_provider_auto_selectable`. So `pkg install
cmd:hi` failed with `cmd:hi (virtual)` for as long as the fixture wrote the
name by hand, and a clause the solver had implemented all along had no case
over it. Now the name arrives with `=1.0-r0` on it and the install picks
`hello`, which pulls `libz`. No C++ moved: `dep_parse` never knew about the
prefix, `index_provides` walks provides already, and the solver compares the
provide's version. §6.1's last paragraph asked for exactly that, and the way to
confirm it was to add nothing.

**The key generator went into `ed25519.py` rather than beside it.** §10's first
step is "make a key" and nothing could be typed to do it: `generate()` was a
library call `mkrepo.py` reached into, and `openssl genpkey` writes PKCS#8
where `load()` wants thirty-two raw bytes. A `main()` in the file that already
holds every key operation keeps the count at one; a `tools/mkkey.py` would have
been a second file whose whole content is an import. It refuses to write over a
path that exists, since the failure mode of a key generator is a key replaced.

**§10 is a tutorial in a grammar document, deliberately.** The rest of the file
says what `pkg` reads; §10 is the only part addressed to a person, and it is
appended rather than inserted so that §9's number — cited from that document's
own preamble and from this file — stays where it is.

## What a transaction touched, and who wanted to know

P25, the last of Phase F. P24 left `.trigger` almost nothing to build — it was
already unpacked into the store directory and recorded, being a dot-entry that
is not `.PKGINFO`, and `script_run` already spawned a script by kind. What was
missing was the firing rule, and neither format document said a word of it: §3.2
had one row reading "trigger globs, space-separated" and §5.1 one line. So this
landed a rule as much as it landed code, and the rule is §5.1.1.

apk's `fire_triggers` is ported whole. The interesting part of porting it was
deciding what a *directory the transaction modified* means in a system that
deletes nothing.

**`/pkg/bin` is what a removal changes.** apk marks a directory modified when it
deletes files from it, so removing a font package wakes the font cache. Here a
removal writes nothing at all — the bytes stay in the store for a rollback, and
the generation simply stops naming them. The one thing that did change is
§8.3's link farm, and `/pkg/bin` resolves through `/pkg/active` to new contents.
Putting it in the modified set is not an extra rule bolted on; it is the same
rule pointed at the place where this system records that the installed set
moved. Without it a removal could never wake anything, and "uninstall the
package, the cache still lists it" would have no expressible fix.

**The `+` prefix was ported rather than dropped into §9**, and it is worth
writing down what it actually does, because the obvious reading is wrong. A `+`
glob does not mean "only fire on a change". It means *only hand over changed
directories* — a `+` glob matching an unmodified directory still wakes the
trigger, and merely withholds that directory from argv. So a freshly installed
package whose globs are all `+` runs its trigger with an empty argv rather than
not running. Two of the unit cases exist for exactly that, because it is the
kind of thing that gets quietly implemented backwards.

**The matcher had to learn about slashes.** `glob_match` is the shell's
per-component matcher and its `*` crosses anything, because `glob.cpp` walks the
components and never asks it to. A trigger glob is matched against a whole path,
so `/pkg/store/*` would have named every directory under the store rather than
one package. `trigger_match` splits both sides on `/` and matches component by
component, which is apk's `FNM_PATHNAME` and is what lets `*` stand for the
stem and nothing more.

**The rule is a pure file, not a loop inside `settle`.** `trigger.cpp` takes a
glob list, a fresh flag and a list of directories-with-a-modified-bit, and
answers whether the trigger fires and what it is handed. Three inputs, no
syscall, so it compiles into `tests.wasm` and the whole of apk's semantics —
first-glob-wins, `+`, absolute-only, fresh-versus-modified — is a table of cases
rather than something only an end-to-end test could reach. `install.cpp` is left
gathering the two directory sets and spawning.

The second set — every directory of every installed package — is read back from
the §8.1 records rather than remembered, and only when some package about to be
installed carries a `g:` at all. A transaction with no triggers in it does no
extra reads and asks no extra questions, which is the same shape as P24's stat:
the common case is a package that only places files, and it must keep costing
nothing.

## Six scripts, and the moment they run around

P24 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). Package_Formats.md §5.1 has
named `.pre-install` and its five relatives since P14, and `zip_meta` has
returned a kind for each of them, but `unpack` wrote only `ZipMeta::Payload` —
so a package carrying scripts installed with them silently dropped on the floor.
They run now. Package_Management.md §11 needed nothing said that it had not
already said, which is what a policy document written before the code is for.

**A script is an ordinary file of the package, kept in the store directory.**
apk puts them beside the record, in `/lib/apk/db/<pkg>.<script>`; here they go
into `/pkg/store/<name>-<version>/` under their own dot-names with an `F`/`R`/`Z`
row apiece. They have to be kept somewhere — `pre-deinstall` runs at a removal,
when the archive is long gone — and the store directory is the one place where
keeping them costs nothing else. `pkg verify` re-hashes them, `pkg files` lists
them, `store_drop` and `pkg clean` collect them with the package, and not one of
those four learned a rule. The alternative would have taught `pkg clean`'s stem
scan about a naming convention, given `pkg verify` a blind spot, and left the
files unhashed.

The rule is every dot-entry but `.PKGINFO`, not the six by name. `.PKGINFO` is
excluded because §8.1's record supersedes it — that is §5.1's own reason for it
existing. The generalisation is what leaves P25 nothing to store: `.trigger` is
already unpacked and recorded, and only the firing rule is missing.

**The commit is the line between `pre-` and `post-`.** apk draws it at
extraction, and that boundary does not exist here. Nothing is extracted into
place: the unpack writes into a store directory nothing yet names, and §8.3's
rename of `/pkg/active` is the single moment anything outside the transaction
can observe. So every `pre-` script runs after every package is fetched, checked
and unpacked, and every `post-` script runs after the rename. The consequence is
worth stating: a `post-` script can run what was just installed, because
`/pkg/bin` points at the new generation, and a `pre-` script cannot. Drawing the
line where apk draws it would have marked a moment at which nothing happens.

**A failing script does not abort.** §11 already required that, and gave the
reason: it is what leaves `pkg verify` something to find. So a non-zero exit is
`pkg: <stem>: post-upgrade failed (1)` on stderr, a `b:` in the record, and a
transaction that carries on to its commit. The mark is written by reading the
record back and writing it again rather than folded into the staged text,
because `unpack` serialises that text while the archive is still alive and a
`post-` failure arrives long after — one path for both halves beats two.

`b` is lowercase, and §1 is why. An unknown uppercase letter makes a record
unusable; an unknown lowercase one is ignored. A future reader that does not
understand "broken" loses a warning, which is bad. One that refused the record
would lose `pkg list`, `pkg files` and the installed set `read_installed` hands
the solver, which is worse. Fail-closed is not automatically the safer choice —
it is only safer when what closes is smaller than what breaks.

The fixture is a package called `noisy` carrying all six scripts, each echoing
its own name and arguments, whose 1.1 `post-upgrade` exits 1 — one package for
the happy path and the broken one. It lives in two indexes of its own rather
than joining the existing pair, so every assertion written before it is
undisturbed by a package that exists to make noise. Its scripts carry no `#!`,
which is not an oversight: they are spawned as `/bin/sh <file>`, and the fixture
is where that stops being a claim.

## A namespace with no code in it

P23 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), which turned out to be a
paragraph rather than a patch. `cmd:awk` has worked everywhere it is *read*
since P14: `dep_parse` takes it as an ordinary name, `index_provides` finds it
under `p:`, and the solver resolves it through the provider machinery apk's own
fixtures exercise. What was missing was the rule saying where such a name comes
from — the whole of it was one clause of Package_Formats.md §6, "an ordinary name
whose providers ship an `awk`", which says nothing about which files produce
one, with what version, or who writes them. §6.1 is now that rule, and the task
is deleted having added no code at all.

**`bin/` was chosen so that one set serves twice.** `cmd:x` names an entry of
the package's `bin/`, flat, which is exactly what §8.3's link farm carries —
`store_commands` lists that directory and skips subdirectories, and `gen_ops`
makes one link per entry. So `cmd:x` holds precisely when typing `x` runs this
package's file. Any other rule would have been a second definition of "a
command this package ships", and two definitions of one thing drift.

That is also why the rule does not ask whether the entry is a *program*
(Concept.md §4). It could: a scanner can look for the `braam` section or a `#!`.
But the farm does not ask, so a `bin/` entry that is not a program is already on
`PATH` and already answers 126, and a `cmd:` rule that skipped it would make the
two sets differ in exactly the case where a package is already wrong. The
namespace should describe what the farm does, not correct it.

**The version is the difference between a name you can install and one you can
only depend on.** A name whose providers are all unversioned is virtual: there
is nothing for the solver to choose between, and `pkg install cmd:awk` refuses.
Emitting `cmd:hi=1.0-r0` — apk's answer, and what
[test/unit/solve.data](../test/unit/solve.data)'s ported cases already assume —
makes the name selectable and makes `cmd:awk>=1.2` mean the providing package's
version. One `=` decides which of two commands the namespace is.

**The publisher derives them, not the packager.** A package cannot be trusted
to describe itself and does not have to be: the index is what vouches, and
§5.1 already requires only `P` and `V` to agree between `.PKGINFO` and the
stanza that signed for it. Since `/pkg/db` is written from the index stanza, an
installed package carries the derived names too, so a solve against the
installed set sees what a solve against the index saw — without a line of code
arranging it.

**The grammar landed a task ahead of the tool on purpose.** `tools/mkindex.py`
still copies `p:` verbatim and P26 still owns changing that. Writing the
definition first is the cheaper order: a producer with no written rule is how an
implementation quietly becomes the specification, and the two `cmd:` strings in
the tree are hand-typed into a fixture precisely because nobody had had to say
what they meant.

The one thing that did move is a row in
[test/unit/test_dep.cpp](../test/unit/test_dep.cpp): §6.1 now mandates a string
form, `cmd:awk=1.2-r0`, and the table only covered the bare name.

## What a clean must not collect

P22 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), the last row of `pkg`'s
table, and the end of Phase E. `pkg clean` drops the download cache, the store
directories no kept generation names, and the generations below the one a
rollback swings back to. Most of it is bookkeeping. The part worth writing down
is what it *keeps*, because both rules were already decided elsewhere and this
is where they finally have to be obeyed.

**A generation survives when it is the active one, when it is above the active
one, or when it is the highest below it.** The first two clauses are one
sentence in `install.cpp` that has been waiting for this task: `next_gen`
counts from the highest generation on disk rather than from the live one,
because "a rollback leaves higher generations standing and P22 keeps them".
After rolling back from 5 to 4, generation 5 is the roll-*forward* target, and
a collector that ate it would make rollback one-way — which is most of what
P18 was built to provide. The third clause is the TODO's own: the generation
before the live one is what rollback swings *to*.

`gen_keep` is pure, in `db.cpp`, and has ten rows in
[test/unit/test_db.cpp](../test/unit/test_db.cpp) rather than a walk through
the code, because the interesting cases are sparse numbering and a rollback,
and a table says which is which.

**No `/pkg/active` keeps everything, and that needs no branch.** With an active
of zero, every generation is above the active one, so the general rule already
answers "collect nothing" for a tree mid-rollback or one whose link somebody
removed by hand. A special case would have had to be right; this one cannot be
wrong.

**The db record goes with the store directory**, and not for tidiness.
`stem_state` compares the record's digest *before* it looks for the directory,
so a record left behind after its bytes were collected answers `Have::Other` —
"installed at a different digest" — for a package that is not installed at any
digest at all. The repository republishes that name-version, and an install
that should refetch refuses instead, permanently. The two files are one fact
about one package and they are collected as one.

**The cache goes whole**, which Package_Formats.md §8 already required, and §8's
own reason is why it costs nothing: a cached archive "is re-hashed against the
index every time it is used and never believed for being on disk", so what a
clean throws away is a download and never a check.

`Dropping` rather than `plan_verb`'s `Purging`: purging means a package left
the installed set, and nothing `clean` touches is installed — that is the
entire criterion for touching it. The name comes back out of the directory
name with `pkg_stem_split`, `pkg_stem`'s inverse, which splits at the first `-`
whose tail is a valid §7 version rather than at the first `-`; `version_valid`
was already there to ask. A directory nothing built keeps its own name in the
report instead of being silently mis-split.

Every row of the table is a command now, so `pkg <name> is not built yet` has
nothing left to answer for and its `smoke` case is gone. The branch stays: a
null `run` is no longer a state the table is in, but it is still what a row
added without its function would be, and the check costs one comparison in a
program that has just made a syscall.

## A digest read back, and what it still does not prove

P21 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). Every install since P18
has written a SHA-256 per file into `/pkg/db/<name>-<version>` — §8.1's `Z`
beside its `R` — and nothing had ever read one. `pkg files` prints the paths
that record names and `pkg verify` hashes the bytes behind them again,
reporting **missing**, **modified** and **extra**. `src/cmd/pkg/verify.cpp` is
both, and it is a file of its own because `query.cpp` says at the top that
nothing in it fetches, checks or writes. Re-hashing the store is a check.

**A clean `verify` prints nothing.** Output means trouble, which is `dpkg -V`'s
shape and `rpm -V`'s, and it is what makes the command usable from a script
without a parser: the status is the answer and the lines are the detail. `pkg
search` with no match already behaved this way, so this is the existing rule
rather than a new one.

**The paths are absolute.** apk prints a package's files relative to a root,
because on apk's system that root is `/` and the relative form is the useful
one. Here a package's files live under `/pkg/store/<name>-<version>/` and are
reached through a symlink farm; `bin/hi` would name nothing a reader could
open. So `files` prints what exists, which is also what `verify` names in its
own report, so a line from one can be pasted into the other.

**Extras come from a walk, not from a second record.** There is nothing to
compare a directory listing against except the record itself — which is exactly
the point, since a file that the record does not name is by construction one
nothing accounted for. Only files are reported: an unrecorded empty directory
is not evidence of anything. The walk is iterative, over a worklist of
directories rather than a coroutine per level, because a coroutine per level is
a frame per level and §2's rule about frames does not stop applying because the
recursion is shallow in practice. `file_matches` streams the file a chunk at a
time into the running `Sha256` for the same reason P6 put SHA-256 in wasm at
all: nothing large has to exist anywhere at once.

**The disclaimer had to reach the help text.** Package_Management.md §11 has
said from the start that the store is not tamper-evident: checking happens once,
at install, there are no file permissions here, every mount but `/proc` is the
one read-write store, and `rm /bin/pkg` already works. A command named `verify`
invites precisely the reading §11 denies, and a caveat that lives only in a
design document is not a caveat anybody reads. So `/share/help` gained a
`Packages` section — `pkg`'s subcommands, which
[pkg.cpp](../src/cmd/pkg/pkg.cpp)'s table comment had been promising to that
file for six tasks — and the sentence sits under the command it is about.

What `verify` is worth, stated positively: it answers *did what I installed
change*, over an interrupted write, a store a `#!` script scribbled on, or a
generation someone edited by hand. It does not answer *can I trust what is
there*. The first question has an answer here and the second needs a privilege
boundary this system does not have.

`clean` is the one row of the table `/share/help` does not list, since a manual
that names a command answering "not built yet" is worse than one that waits.
P22 adds the line with the code.

Two functions moved down into `db.cpp` on the way: `installed_version`, which
was a file-local in `query.cpp` and is now what both readers of a generation
call, and `db_join`, `db_split`'s inverse. The rule that placed them is the one
that placed everything else in `src/cmd/pkg/`: pure goes down where
`tests.wasm` can reach it, and both have cases in
[test/unit/test_db.cpp](../test/unit/test_db.cpp) — `db_join` tested by round
trip, since an inverse that is asserted rather than exercised is two chances to
be wrong instead of one.

## One transaction, because the signature covers one file

P20 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the last of Phase E's
commands that change the installed set. `pkg upgrade` is thirty lines of
arity check, `begin`, `SOLVE_UPGRADE`, `decide`, `settle`. The work was the
fixture.

**It is one solve and one generation, and that is a requirement rather than a
convenience.** §6's "the whole package set, signed as one file" is what stops
an attacker combining packages that never went together, and a loop of installs
would re-solve between each one and hand back exactly what the signed set was
protecting. The shape P18 built happens to be the shape that preserves it: one
`solve()` over all of world, one `store_perform`, one rename.

**`SOLVE_UPGRADE` and nothing else.** apk's upgrade branch sets the run-wide
flag and, given operands, clears it again and flags the named packages instead.
There are no operands here — TODO's table says `pkg upgrade` with no argument,
and "commit one generation for the lot" reads that way — so an argument is a
usage error. `-a/--available`, `-l/--latest` and `--prune` are not built
either. The flag rides on the `Txn` now and `decide` passes it, which is the
whole of the plumbing.

**An upgrade's changes are installs, so nothing new performs them.** They carry
a `new_pkg` and a real verb, so `settle`'s `realise` loop fetches, checks the
digest and unpacks each one, and a provider swap that arrives as a `Purging`
beside an `Installing` in the same changeset needs no case of its own. The new
version unpacks into a **new** store directory — `<name>-<new version>` — so
nothing the running generation is executing out of is touched while the
transaction is still able to fail.

**The version it came from stays.** Its store directory and its `/pkg/db`
record are what the previous generation names, and that generation is what a
rollback swings back to; `pkg clean` collects them at P22. Same rule as a
removal's, and the smoke test asserts both are still there after an upgrade.

**P18's different-digest refusal is out of reach while the record and the index
agree about a version** — which is the only state a working repository
produces. A bare upgrade sets no `SOLVE_AVAILABLE`, so a repository that
republishes an installed version under new bytes loses: `compare_providers`
skips its early `ipkg` rung under `SOLVE_UPGRADE`, but its last rung still
prefers the installed package once the versions compare equal. No `Replacing`,
so `stem_state` is never asked. That is what apk's `-a` exists to override, and
not building it is what keeps the store's immutability from being tested here.

It is worth saying what that does *not* cover, since the first draft of this
paragraph claimed more. Three rungs sit **above** the version comparison —
`selectable`, `deps_used` and `conflicts` — and they can differ between two
copies of one name-version when the *local record* and the index disagree about
metadata: an installed stanza whose own `D:` nothing satisfies is disqualified
by `disqualify_package`, and the index's copy then wins at an equal version.
That is a `Replacing`, and it does reach the refusal. The right answer is still
a refusal — §8 makes a store directory immutable and a rollback target may be
executing out of it — but it is reachable, and by exactly the hand-doctored
record P18's own suite plants.

**Nor does `pkg upgrade` fetch an index first**, for the reason `pkg install`
does not: §7's checks belong to the command that fetches one, and a command
that quietly refreshed the index would choose what to install from bytes nobody
asked for.

**The fixture gained a second index rather than a second version of
everything.** `tools/mkrepo.py` now signs `@index` (G:1, `libz-1.0-r0` and
`hello-1.0-r0`) and `@index2` (G:2, the same libz and `hello-1.1-r0`), so the
smoke test can watch an upgrade move one package and leave the other exactly
where it was — a set-wide bump would have proved less. `hello-1.1-r0`'s
`bin/hi` prints different text, so the link farm is checked by *running* it:
`hi` says the new thing without anything having been told a generation changed.

One line of that suite is worth more than it looks: **`pkg install hello`
against the new index does nothing.** Without `SOLVE_UPGRADE` the solver keeps
what is installed whatever the index now offers, which is the difference
between the two commands stated as a test.

`/bin/pkg` is 181,883 bytes, from 180,174; the staging tree 983,973 of 2 MiB.

## The purge was already written

P19 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `pkg remove` takes a name
out of `/pkg/world` and re-solves; `pkg autoremove` re-solves without taking
anything out. Both commit a generation the way P18 does, and between them they
are about eighty lines, because the work is somewhere else.

**The solver already drops what world does not reach, so neither command walks
the graph.** `generate_changeset`'s three sweeps
([solve.cpp:1116-1144](../src/cmd/pkg/solve.cpp#L1116)) emit a removal for
every installed package whose name has no requirer and no chosen provider, and
`cset_track_deps_removed` recurses into each dependency as its last requirer
goes. Fixture `basic14` — `del a` with world `a` — expects `Purging a` *and*
`Purging b`, and `basic4`, the same shape with `b` in world, expects only
`Purging a`. So reachability from world is the whole of what "explicitly
installed" means here, and `autoremove` is the re-solve with nothing else
attached. Writing a reachability pass would have been writing the solver twice.

Nor is there an uninstall step. `plan_installed` builds a generation from the
changes that carry a `new_pkg`, so **a removal is expressed as absence** — the
new `packages` and the new `bin/` simply do not name it. `realise` skips a
change with no `new_pkg`, which is exactly what a `Purging` is, so P18's commit
path took a removal without a line of change.

**A removal solves against the installed set alone, and that is a property
rather than an economy.** `SolveInput::repo` is left empty, which
[solve.cpp:427](../src/cmd/pkg/solve.cpp#L427) makes harmless — `p.selectable
= p.available || … || p.ipkg`, so what is installed stays selectable with no
repository at all. What it buys: no change can name a package that is not
already unpacked, so **a removal can never fetch**, never consults
`/pkg/index`, and works with no network and no `pkg update` behind it. apk's
`del` re-solves against the repositories and may swap in a different provider,
which would have needed a fetch, a digest check and an unpack on a code path
whose whole point is that it destroys nothing.

The cost is one refusal that reads oddly: a world entry nothing installed
satisfies stops a removal with `ghost (no such package)`, which under a full
index means "the index does not list it" and here means "nothing installed
provides it". That is reachable by hand-editing world, so it has a test rather
than a fix; `pkg install` is what repairs a world the store cannot satisfy.

**`SOLVE_REMOVE` unseats a preference; it does not uninstall.** It suppresses
the installed-package rung of `compare_providers`
([solve.cpp:769](../src/cmd/pkg/solve.cpp#L769)) so that a name something else
still needs is not re-picked out of habit — but if that name is still required,
its provider is still chosen. So `pkg remove libz` while `hello` needs it
changes nothing, and printing `generation 3, unchanged` alone would have looked
like success. It prints `pkg: libz: still needed by hello` first, before the
commit, which is apk's order.

That report can be computed at all because the changeset carries the
*unchanged* packages too — `cset_gen_name_change` records `(old, new)` even
when they are the same package, and `plan_verb` then returns an empty verb. So
the changes with a non-null `new_pkg` are the complete surviving set even when
nothing is printed, which is what makes both `plan_installed` and `survives`
correct.

**Exit 1, where `apk del` exits 0.** apk prints its not-removed report and
commits regardless, and the status says only whether the commit worked. Here a
named operand that could not be honoured is 1, which is what `pkg info
nonesuch` and `pkg install nonesuch` already answer. The pair does read oddly —
`pkg remove nosuch`, a name that was never installed, is a quiet 0, while
`pkg remove libz`, a name that is, is 1 — and that is the right way round: the
first did what was asked, the second did not. **World is rewritten either way**,
so the message says `; world updated` when it was: a name that stayed has
stopped being explicit, and would go at the next `autoremove` without it.

**A removal drops no bytes.** `/pkg/store/<stem>` and `/pkg/db/<stem>` stay
where they are, because the previous generation still names them and that is
what rolling back means. `pkg clean` collects them (P22), and P18's rule —
never `store_drop` on a removal — is what makes the rollback in the test
meaningful.

**Only an install builds `/pkg`.** `pkg_tree_ops` moved behind the same flag
that loads the index, because a removal writes nothing a generation has not
already created — and without the flag, `pkg remove nonesuch` on a machine that
had never installed anything would have created `/pkg`, four directories and a
dangling `/pkg/bin` in the course of doing nothing. On that tree the summary
also had to change: `store_active()` answers 0, and there is no generation 0,
so it says `nothing installed`.

**`world_drop` erases every line naming a package, not the first.** World is a
file people edit, and a name written twice would otherwise leave a line behind
that makes the package permanently unremovable — reported forever as still
needed, by nobody.

**`pkg install`'s head and tail became `begin`, `decide` and `settle`**, and
the record it carries is a `Txn` now rather than an `Install`, since three
commands share it. P20 is the fourth and should be a dozen lines. `/bin/pkg`
is 180,174 bytes, from 171,351 — two commands for nine kilobytes, most of it
their text — and the staging tree 982,264 of the 2 MiB the last entry raised
it to.

## One rename, and everything above it is a check

P18 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `pkg install` is
Package_Management.md §7's steps 8 to 10 and then §8.3's commit: fetch each
package capped at the size the index gave, hash what arrived, and only then
unzip into `/pkg/store/`, build `/pkg/gen/<N>/` whole and swing `/pkg/active`
onto it. `solve.cpp`, `gen_ops`, `zip_read` and `store_commands` all get their
first caller.

**§7's crossing is a function, not a comment.** The rule — *nothing is
unzipped, written to the store, or run before its hash matches a hash from a
signed index* — is the whole point of the task, so it is `index_fetch` in
[index.cpp](../src/cmd/pkg/index.cpp): it derives the URL from the header's
`N`, caps the body at `S` through the `ZipSink` the index fetch already used,
and returns `Err` unless `package_check` agrees on both the size and the
digest. It lives beside steps 1 to 7 rather than in `install.cpp` because
`index.cpp` takes a `PkgHost` and is compiled into `tests.wasm`, so the two
refusals that matter most — a byte changed after signing, a body longer than
`S` — are driven by `ctest -R unit` and not only by the browser harness. What
crosses the line in `install.cpp` is then two statements with the rule written
between them.

**The record is what a reinstall re-checks, so it decides three ways.** §7 says
`pkg` keeps its own record of which index version vouched for what, *so that a
reinstall re-checks rather than believing the disk*. `/pkg/db/<stem>` is that
record and `stem_state` reads it before any fetch: no record means rebuild, a
record whose `C` is the one the index gives now means there is nothing to do,
and a record whose `C` differs is a **refusal**. The third row is the one that
matters. A store directory is keyed by `<name>-<version>` and §8 makes it
immutable once written, so a repository that republishes a version under new
bytes would otherwise have `pkg` write over files a live generation is
executing out of. Refusing costs a rebuild nobody asked for and keeps the
property the task exists for.

**Rebuilding is safe because records are written last.** A `Remove` of a store
directory is only reachable when there is no db record for it, and a record is
only written at the commit — so no committed generation can name a directory
this run is willing to destroy. That one ordering is what lets a dead tab's
half-unpack be cleared without a rule about which generations are live.

**Nothing under `/pkg/db` is written before every package has unpacked.** Each
record is serialised into memory as its package finishes, because a `DbFile`
views the archive and the archive is released next, and the texts go out with
the commit. The commit is then one list — a `Write` per record, `/pkg/world`,
then `gen_ops` — performed by one `store_perform` that ends in the rename. A
failure before it leaves store directories nothing refers to, which is
`pkg clean`'s to collect, and `/pkg/active` where it was.

**`^C` is the tab dying, and that is not a gap.** System_Calls.md §8:
`Cancelled` never reaches a process, because the instance is dropped and
[rt.h](../src/proc/rt.h) says a killed process never unwinds. So no cleanup of
`pkg`'s runs on `^C`, and the `Error::Cancelled → 130` mapping is convention
rather than machinery. The property the task asks for does not come from a
handler: it comes from the ordering, and it holds for a killed process, a
closed tab and a crashed one alike.

**World runs ahead of the generation, never behind.** `/pkg/world` is written
in the same list as the commit but before the rename, so a tab that dies
between them leaves a wish nothing fulfils — which the same command run again
fixes. The other order would leave a package installed that nothing explicitly
wants, and only `pkg autoremove` would ever find it. For the same reason an
install with nothing to do still writes world: making an implicit package
explicit must not be silent.

**The generation number counts directories, not the active link.** `N` is one
past the highest `/pkg/gen/<n>`. After a rollback — which §8.3 says is swinging
the link back — the active generation is not the highest one, and
`store_active() + 1` would have `gen_ops`'s leading `Remove` destroy exactly
the generation P22 is told to keep.

**The cache is re-hashed, not believed.** `/pkg/cache/<name>-<version>.zip` is
written *after* the digest matched, so no unverified bytes ever reach the disk,
and a later install uses it only when it hashes to what the index says now.
That departs from the task's wording, which had the download streamed into the
cache as it arrived; the archive is held whole for `zip_entries` either way, so
streaming bought no memory and cost the crossing its strictness. What it buys
instead is real: install, roll back, install again costs no network.

**`I` stops being decoration.** `S` bounds the compressed archive and says
nothing about what it unpacks to. `I` is inside the signed body and therefore
as trusted as `C`, so the payload entries' declared sizes must sum to no more
than it, and to no more than `UNPACK_MAX` when a stanza carries none — which
bounds a single entry too. `PACKAGE_MAX` bounds `S` itself at four megabytes,
since the archive is held whole and a process has sixteen.

**`.PKGINFO` cannot be a §3.2 stanza, and the format now says so.** `C` and `S`
name the archive and cannot be inside it, so `package_read` — which requires
both — would refuse every well-formed one. Package_Formats.md §5.1 gains the
sentence: `.PKGINFO` is required, carries §3.2's letters less those two, is
read field by field, and `P` and `V` are what must agree with the index, since
they are what choose the store directory and the generation's line. Comparing
the list fields as well would refuse a good package over a space.

**The refusal names the step, the way `pkg update`'s does.** `pkg:
libz-1.0-r0: digest: permission denied` and `pkg: libz-1.0-r0: package:
invalid` are one `Error` and two answers, and the word between the colons is
the difference — `IndexStep` gains `Package` and `Digest` for exactly that.

**`install.cpp` keeps its own printer.** apk's verbs are what a changeset
reads as, and `plan.cpp` holds them, but `test/unit/test_solve.cpp`'s
`render()` is left alone rather than rewired through the product: the fixture
format is a fixture format, and coupling 72 cases to a command's output would
make improving one of them break the other. `plan_verb` returning an empty
verb doubles as the test for whether a change is work, so the plan that is
printed and the work that is done come off one function and cannot drift.

**The installed set has to come out of `/pkg/db`, and that is not tidiness.**
`solve()` keys package identity on the digest, so stanzas synthesised from a
generation's name-and-version lines would all carry the same thirty-two zero
bytes and collapse into one package. A generation line with no readable record
is therefore a refusal naming the file — a store the database does not
describe is broken, and P21 is where that gets diagnosed.

**Four of P26's tools arrived early, because a signed happy path needs them.**
`test/unit/index.data`'s keys were destroyed when it was signed, so no package
could be added to it and no fixture could be signed under it. Rather than
regenerate that file — which would have meant re-deriving its eight attack
variants and every literal digest asserted over them — `tools/mkrepo.py`
writes a second fixture, `test/unit/repo.data`: its own anchor, one signed
index and two small packages, over throwaway keys generated in a temporary
directory and destroyed before it returns. §9 stays true, and `index.data` and
every refusal tested against it keep the bytes they always had.
`tools/ed25519.py` is the only thing in the tree that imports `cryptography`,
and only signing needs it — what is checked in was signed once, and verifying
is `Sys::Verify`.

**The packages are shell scripts, so the fixture is two kilobytes.** A `#!`
file is a program here, which `exec_resolve` chases, so `hello`'s `bin/hi` is
three lines and the smoke test can prove the whole of activation by typing
`hi` at a prompt: `/pkg/bin` is the second component of the default search
list, and nothing had to be told a generation appeared.

**`test/fakesvc.mjs` learns to answer with bytes.** A route body was
`TextEncoder`-ed, and a zip does not survive that. One line, in the shared
fake, so a package can be served at all.

**`/bin/pkg` is 171 KB, from 86.** `solve.cpp` and the newly reachable bodies
of `zip.cpp`, `unzip.cpp` and `db.cpp` are most of it. The staging tree is
973,441 bytes, which fitted the old 1 MiB budget with 75 KB to spare — and P19
to P22 all land on this one binary, so the next task would have broken the
build rather than reported anything.

**So the staging budget is 2 MiB.** Raising it is a deliberate act, and this is
the entry that says why: `/bin/pkg` is a package manager, and a package manager
is a solver, a version grammar, a stanza reader, a zip reader and a digest.
That is not §4.4's duplication, which is what the number exists to bound — the
duplication is the process runtime every binary carries, and it did not move.
One program grew, once, for a reason that will not repeat. The bound stays a
bound: 973,441 against 2 MiB is not room to stop watching, it is room for the
four commands that finish the one program this was raised for. `kernel.wasm`
keeps its 262,144 unchanged, which is the number that would mean something had
gone wrong.

## A solver with no way back, and 72 fixtures that say so

P17 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `solve.cpp` is apk's
solver ported: discovery, unit propagation, one greedy decision at a time, and
a changeset in dependency order. It is pure — the index and the installed set
arrive as stanzas the caller holds — so it compiles into `tests.wasm` beside
`index.cpp` and a syscall in it is a link error. Nothing calls it yet; P18 is
its first caller, and `/bin/pkg` is byte-for-byte the size it was, because
`--gc-sections` never extracts an archive member nobody references.

**There is no backtracking, and `conflicts` is what replaces it.** Every
constraint that a package fails bumps a counter that only ever increases, so a
package disqualified once is disqualified for good and no decision ever has to
be unwound. What that buys is a solver with no search stack and no exponential
corner; what it costs is that a contradiction is *reported* rather than
retried. The fixtures are full of contradictions, which is the point: apk's
`error*.test` cases exist to pin down what a refusal says.

**The fixtures are the specification, so they came in as a file rather than as
prose.** `tools/mkfixtures.py` derives `test/unit/solve.data` from
`apk-tools/test/solver/` — 72 cases over 36 index and installed-db fixtures,
23 KB — the way `version.data` already carries apk's version suite.
Keeping the converter in the tree rather than hand-editing the output is what
makes the derivation auditable: every re-spelling below is one function in it,
and re-running it against a newer apk is a command rather than a merge.

**`@EXPECT` keeps apk's verbs and loses its printer.** The `(N/M)` counter is a
progress meter and `OK: 2 B in 2 packages` is a `du`; neither is a decision the
solver makes. What is left — `Installing b (2)`, `Upgrading app (1 -> 2)`,
`Purging libold (1)`, in apk's order — is exactly the changeset, and the order
is most of what is being asserted. An error block keeps its `ERROR:` header and
its package labels and drops the `breaks:`/`satisfies:` prose beneath them,
which would have meant porting apk's reporter, its second reachability pass and
its greedy wrap at column fifty for no gain in what is being proved.

**A label is a package that breaks a constraint, not one that failed.** The
first attempt marked every package the solver could not keep, and `error1`
answered with three labels where apk prints one. The reason is that apk's
reporter re-derives what breaks from the graph: the solver stops applying a
constraint once the name behind it has no options left, so `d-2.0`'s counter
never records the `d<2.0` that condemns it. `breaks_something` walks world and
the chosen set at report time instead, which is what makes `error1` one label
and `error3` two.

**Two re-spellings, and one of them was the whole of the last four failures.**
apk accumulates a repeated `D:`, `p:` or `i:`; Package_Formats.md §1 calls that
malformed and §6 makes the list space-separated, so the converter folds the
lines into the one spelling this grammar defines. And `C:` is apk's Q1, which
is SHA-1, where §1.1 takes SHA-256 alone — so it is restamped by hashing the
old digest, which keeps equal equal and distinct distinct. It has to hash the
**decoded bytes**, not the text. `installif1.repo` spells one digest two ways —
`…yysF=` and `…yysE=` differ only in the padding bits base64 discards — so
`libiif` collides with `bar` in apk's package table and never becomes a package
at all. Hashing the text separated them, and a package Alpine has never had
appeared in four expected outputs. That is also why `solve()` keys its own
table on the digest across the whole index and not merely across the index and
the installed set.

**`so:` turns out not to exist.** P17 said to drop the cases that only exercise
pinning or `so:`. Pinning is real and fifteen cases go with it. `so:` is not:
apk's sources contain no occurrence of the string, and `so:libfoo.so.1`,
`cmd:sh`, `pc:zlib` and `/bin/sh` are ordinary names whose colons and slashes
Braam's `dep_parse` already accepts, its name scan stopping only at `< > = ~`.
So nothing was dropped for it and all twenty-two `provides*` cases stand.

**The 47 dropped, each needing something a solver is not:** fifteen for
repository pinning; eight for apk upgrading itself; six for the `fix` applet;
four for `-t .virtual`, a package built on the command line; three for
`--no-network` or a cache index, which is availability masking; three for
`-v`'s verbose summary and its no-longer-available note; three for world
dependency spellings rejected before the solver is reached; two for
`--force-broken-world`; one for arch; one for an index dependency carrying
`@tag`; and one for `apk del`'s not-removed report. The generated file's header
lists them by name, so the drop list cannot drift from the code that applies
it.

## Three rows that only read

P16 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `pkg search`, `pkg info`
and `pkg list` are what makes an update's result inspectable: two of them read
`/pkg/index` as P15 left it, the third reads the active generation. Nothing in
`query.cpp` fetches, checks or writes, and the solver lands next against a tree
where "what does the index actually say" is one word rather than `cat` and a
grammar.

**The stored index is read, not re-checked.** `index_read` is `signed_split`,
the signature block, §3.1's header and the packages — and none of §7's steps 4
to 6. That looks like a gap and is the opposite: the signature was checked when
the file arrived, and checking it again would say only that the file still says
what it said. §11 is explicit that an installed file carries no lasting
guarantee, and a `pkg info` that verified a signature would be claiming a
property the store does not have. The one check that survives is §3.1's `X`,
because a grammar this is not is a file that cannot be read at all rather than a
file that might be wrong.

**The pattern's shape picks the matcher.** A live `*`, `?` or `[…]` globs the
name and the description whole; anything else is a substring that ignores case.
Two behaviours behind one argument is usually a smell, but the alternative is
worse in both directions: glob-only means `pkg search awk` finds nothing until
you type `'*awk*'`, and substring-only means the metacharacters a user has typed
are matched literally, which nobody intends. apk resolves it the same way, and
the shell's `glob_meta` is exactly the question being asked, so the rule is one
call rather than a heuristic. Case folding applies only to the substring half —
a glob is the shell's matcher and the shell's matcher is case-sensitive, and
making it otherwise here would be a second dialect of one pattern language.

**A search that found nothing is 0, and an `info` that found nothing is 1.**
They look like the same event and are not. `pkg search nonesuch` asked a
question the index answered: no packages match, which is a result. `pkg info
nonesuch` named a package, and §7 step 7 is that a name the index does not list
does not exist and is not looked for anywhere else — so the answer is a refusal,
with the sentence spelled out rather than left to `errln`, which would have said
"no such file" about something that is not a file.

**`list` reads the generation, and only the generation.** Not the index, which
describes a repository rather than this machine, and not `/pkg/world`, which is
what was *asked for* rather than what is *there*. `store_active` follows
`/pkg/active` and `packages_read` parses what it points at, so the command
inherits §8.3's property for free: whatever the link names is a generation that
was committed whole. `info`'s `installed` row comes from the same two calls, and
is absent rather than "no" when nothing matches — an absent field is how every
other row in that listing behaves.

**The matcher is compiled into `braam_pkg` rather than linked from
`braam_sh`.** `match.cpp` is `Str` and `Span` and nothing else, which is what
already lets `tests.wasm` compile it; linking the shell for it would drag a
parser, an expander and a job table into `/bin/pkg`. `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt`
had set the precedent for `/bin/test` and `cond.cpp`, and the exact-import
assertion is what keeps the shortcut honest — a pure file compiled twice cannot
move a binary's import list, and `smoke` fails if it does.

## One word, and the first row of the table filled

P15 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the first of Phase E.
`pkg update` reads `/pkg/repositories`, runs `index_check` over the one line it
finds, and writes the checked file to `/pkg/index`. Two commits' worth of
machinery had no caller; now it has one, and typing the word is the whole of
what a user has to do.

**The record is P15's because a refusal must leave nothing behind.**
`index_check` writes nothing at any of its seven steps, which is what makes "any
failure abandons the whole operation" free rather than a thing to unwind. So the
`Vec<StoreOp>` is built *after* it returns Ok, and `store_perform` is reached on
no other path. `StoreOpKind::Write` truncates in place, so a half-written
`/pkg/index` would be a floor nobody could read — and §7 step 5 now refuses one
of those, which closes the loop the two tasks make between them.

**A second repository is refused rather than ignored.** The format has always
said "one URL per line; today, one line", and the code says why the second half
of that is load-bearing: `/pkg/index` is one file and the rollback floor is one
number, so a second repository's index would be checked against the first's `G`
and whichever wrote last would become the floor for both. Taking only the first
line would hide that; refusing states it. The day there is somewhere to put a
second index, the refusal is the thing to delete, and Package_Formats.md §8 now
carries the reason so nobody has to rediscover it.

**A trailing slash is stripped, which is the one place normalising wins.** `pkg`
refuses rather than normalises everywhere else — base64 spellings, key names,
`X` versions — because two spellings of one *name* are two ways to be trusted.
A repositories line is not a name: `https://…/braam/` and `https://…/braam` are
one repository however they are typed, and the unstripped form fetches
`//index`, which answers 404 with nothing to explain it. Stripping turns a typo
into the obvious intent and cannot conflate two repositories into one.

**The step is the diagnostic.** `Err(Perm)` is a bad signature, an index for
another repository, a rollback and an expired index — four refusals, one error
value, because `Error` has fourteen members and §7 has seven steps. So the line
is `errln("pkg", index_step_name(step), err)`: `pkg: signature: permission
denied` and `pkg: expiry: permission denied` are the same error and different
answers, and the word between the colons is the whole difference. `Cancelled` is
130 and silent, the convention every blocking program in `src/cmd` follows.

**The smoke test plants an anchor over the shipped one, and that is the honest
way round.** The release anchor's private keys were destroyed the moment it was
signed (P13), so nothing can ever be signed *for* it — which is the correct
state for a system with no repository yet, and a wall for a test that wants a
happy path. `test/run.mjs` writes the unit suite's throwaway-key anchor into the
store after boot, routes the indexes already signed under it through `FakeNet`,
and puts the release's bytes back afterwards. What that proves is the pipeline,
the record and the refusals; what it does not prove is anything about the keys
in the archive, and the two should not be confused. The fixtures are
`test/unit/index.data` read straight from `run.mjs` — one set of bytes checked
by both suites, rather than a second set that could drift.

**`pkg update` is what makes the `/pkg` tree.** `pkg_tree_ops` was written for
P18 and is idempotent, so the first command a user runs is where the directories
come into being. `/pkg/bin` dangles until something is installed, which the
activation work already proved harmless: a miss through it is an ordinary 127.

## Seven steps in one screen, over a host it does not have

P14 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the end of Phase D.
`index_check` is Package_Management.md §7's steps 1 to 7 in one function and in
order: the time once, the anchor, the index fetched under a cap, the signatures,
the header, the version, the expiry, the packages. `IndexStep` names the step a
refusal stopped at, and every one of them has a test.

**One `PkgHost` replaced a function pointer written a commit earlier.** P13
injected its verifier because the split by purity did not fall where the split
by testability did. P14 needs five more of the same kind — a clock, a local
file, a fetch, a read, a close — and six parallel `using` declarations would
have been six ways of saying one thing. So `TrustVerify` is gone and
`trust_meet`, `trust_self`, `trust_step`, `trust_walk` and `anchor_load` all
take `PkgHost &`, which is `src/fs/`'s `Fs` pattern applied one layer up.
`anchor.cpp` became `host.cpp` and holds the concrete one; `anchor_load` moved
into `trust.cpp`, where the suite can reach it, and step 2's cases are the first
tests it has had. Rewriting a one-commit-old interface is cheaper than carrying
two.

**The fetch is `open`/`read`/`close` and not `fetch(url, cap)`, and the cap is
the whole reason.** A one-call fetch would have put the counting loop on each
side of the interface: the real one in `host.cpp`, unreachable from the suite,
and a fake one in the test that proves only itself. §3's endless-data row is
stopped by that loop, so it is the loop that has to be tested. Handing back an
opaque token — an fd for `/bin/pkg`, a table index for the suite — puts the loop
in `index.cpp` where the test drives it, including the two cases that matter:
exactly `INDEX_MAX` passes the fetch, one byte more does not, and the body is
closed either way. `ZipSink` was already this: `take` refuses a chunk that would
pass the declared size, which is a cap when `complete()` is not asked.

**512 KiB, because `Sys::Verify` stages the signed bytes whole.** The ceiling is
`SYS_STAGE_MAX` less the key, the signature and two length words — 1,048,472
bytes — and an index that cannot be staged cannot be checked at all. Half of it
leaves a margin nobody has to compute, and is some thousands of package stanzas.
"Well below" was the instruction; a number that needs arithmetic to see is not
well below anything.

**A `/pkg/index` that is present and does not parse refuses the run.** Absent is
a floor of zero, which is §8.2's "a file that is not there reads as an empty
one" and is what lets a `/pkg` that has never been written to need no seeding.
Unreadable is not the same thing: treating it as zero would mean anyone who can
write one byte into `/pkg` erases the rollback check, and §11 already concedes
that anyone can. A refusal there costs a `pkg update` that says why; the
alternative costs the property step 5 exists for.

**`X` and `N` are checked with the header, between steps 4 and 5.** §3.1 said
when `G` and `E` are checked and said nothing about the other two, and they
cannot wait for step 7: the version and the expiry are fields of a header that
has to be parsed to reach them. Package_Formats.md §3.1 now says so.

**The pipeline writes nothing.** §7's steps stop at reading the index; recording
it is the word "record" in P15's "fetch, check, record". Keeping `index_check`
read-only is what makes "any failure abandons the whole operation" free —
there is nothing to undo, at any step, because nothing was done.

**§1's two scopes survive into step 7.** A line that is not a field takes the
whole index down; a stanza with an unknown uppercase letter takes only itself
and the rest are read. That is the stanza grammar's rule rather than a decision
of the pipeline's, and the test asserts both halves so it stays that way.

## The anchor, and a verifier that arrives as an argument

P13 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the first half of
Phase D. `rootfs/share/pkg/anchor` ships in the archive, `trust.cpp` is what
checks one and `anchor.cpp` what reads the shipped one. Nothing fetches yet, so
this lands with no subcommand behind it — the way `Sys::Verify` did, and for the
same reason: the check is worth reviewing before anything depends on it.

**The verifier is a parameter, because the split by purity does not fall where
the split by testability does.** Every other pure piece of `pkg` is pure
outright, so `test/CMakeLists.txt` compiles it in and a syscall in it is a link
error. Threshold counting is not: it is arithmetic with one `co_await` in the
middle, and that `co_await` is `verify_sig` in a process and `svc_verify` in the
kernel — different names, different result types, the same question. Splitting
the module at that call would have put the loop in `braam_pkg`, where the unit
suite cannot reach it, and the "Done when" list is entirely about the loop. So
`TrustVerify` is a function pointer, `/bin/pkg` passes one adapter and
`test_trust.cpp` the other, and `fakesvc.mjs` answers Ed25519 for real. The cost
is one indirect call per signature. The alternative was a second copy of the
counting, which is the thing §7 step 4 says is easiest to get wrong.

**The loop is keys-outer, and the `break` is the rule.** For each key the anchor
names under a use, the signatures are scanned for one that verifies, and the
first that does ends that key's turn. Written the other way round — signatures
outer, keys inner — "at most one signature per key" becomes a set of names seen
so far, which is a second structure to keep correct and a place for a bug to
live. This way the property is the control flow: a key contributes once because
there is no path on which it contributes twice, and a signature repeated is a
key already counted. §2's "a `Y:` naming a key the anchor does not carry counts
for nothing" falls out of the same shape, since a signature nothing matches is
never reached.

**A key's name is recomputed, never read.** The `Y:` line's keyid is a hint for
a human; what the count uses is the SHA-256 of `<algorithm> <base64 key>` taken
from the anchor's own `K:`. That is what makes P6's strict base64 load-bearing
rather than fastidious — a decoder that accepted two spellings would give one
key two names and the threshold two ways to be met by one holder.

**Three things §4 did not say, and now does.** A higher `X` refuses the whole
anchor, which §3.1 had said only of an index. `E` is checked, against the time
§7 step 1 fixes, since an expiry nothing enforces is a comment. And every
anchor — the archive-pinned one included — must meet its own root threshold.
That last one proves nothing cryptographically: whoever edits the file edits the
keys with it. It was taken anyway because it is *one* code path with the chain
step rather than two, and because it refuses an anchor amended by hand after
signing, which is the accident a release process actually has. §6's "trust stops
at the anchor" is about *which keys*, and that is still believed without proof.

**`G` orders the chain and does not have to be contiguous.** §10's walk reads as
1 → 2 → 3, and the obvious implementation demands each step be exactly one. But
the step that matters is the signature: anchor 3 is adopted only when a
threshold of anchor 2's root keys signed it. Withholding 2 is refused by the
signature that is missing, not by the number that is — and requiring +1 would
additionally forbid a publisher who numbered 1 and 3, which nothing asks for.
So the rule is that `G` increases, and the test that anchor 3 is not reachable
from anchor 1 passes without it.

**A `K` of another algorithm is ignored; an `ed25519` one that is not 32 bytes
is fatal.** §8 keeps an algorithm name on every key precisely so a second one
can be added, so a `K:root ecdsa-p256 …` must be skipped rather than refused.
A key that claims the algorithm this reader implements and then is not that
algorithm's size is a different thing: it is malformed, and fail-closed is the
only reading. A malformed *signature* stays in the first camp, counting for
nothing, since a signature block is attacker-supplied on a chain step and
refusing the file would hand an attacker a way to stop a rotation.

**The shipped anchor's private keys were destroyed the moment it was signed.**
There is no repository yet, so its four keys are throwaway: three root, one
index, generated once outside the tree, the anchor signed two-of-three, and the
private halves gone. §9's "no private key in the git tree, in anything built
from it, or inside `rootfs.zip`" is then not a rule anyone has to keep. What
ships is a well-formed anchor naming keys nobody holds, so the first `pkg
update` to meet a repository will refuse it — which is the correct answer until
`tools/mkanchor.py` (P26) signs a real one. The file cannot be edited by hand
either, since the self-check is a real check; amending it means regenerating it.

**Its expiry is watched by `run.mjs` and by nothing else.** The anchor stops
working a year out, and no test with a fixed clock would ever say so — the unit
fixtures carry their own `E` and their own `now` on purpose, so that they do not
rot. The smoke test runs under Node against a real clock, so that is where the
archive's anchor is read and its `E:` compared against `Date.now()`. It is a
build-time alarm for a run-time expiry, which is the only place the two meet.

**`/share` gained a directory, and two counted things moved.** `ls /share` is
three names now, `pkg/` marked as a directory, and `rootfs.zip` is 44 entries
rather than 43. Both were assertions rather than incidental — which is what they
are for.

## Activation is one constant

P12 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the end of Phase C.
`SYS_PATH_DEFAULT` is `/bin:/pkg/bin`, init plants the same list, and a
`static_assert` holds the two together. That is the whole of it: `exec_resolve`
is untouched, no clause was added to command resolution, and the kernel still
knows none of `/pkg`'s file formats.

Concept.md §4 argued this before there was anything to activate, so what is new
here is that it is done — and the rest of this entry is what the argument turned
out to be worth once it was.

**The four ways it can be broken all cost nothing.** A missing `/pkg`, a
dangling `/pkg/active`, a farm entry pointing into a store directory that is not
there, and a name no generation lists are each a `PATH` component that finds
nothing. `exec.cpp` already continued on `NotFound`, `NotDir` and `IsDir`,
already answered `Err(NotFound)` and 127, and already had a test saying so. The
smoke test now walks all four and gets one 127 each. **Not one of them is a new
failure path**, and that is the property the fourth clause would have spent: a
clause reading `/pkg/active` and a generation file on every failed lookup has
four ways to be half-installed, and each of them has to be turned back into an
ordinary "command not found" by hand.

**Boot does not create `/pkg`.** `make_dirs` still makes `/home` and `/import`
and nothing else. A system that never installs anything never grows a `/pkg`,
and the tree is P11's `pkg_tree_ops` to build on the first write. Creating it at
boot would have put an empty directory and a dangling `/pkg/bin` on every
machine to buy a component that already costs nothing when it is absent.

**`init`'s `PATH` and the kernel's default were two literals.** `base_env` in
`boot.cpp` spelled `PATH=/bin` out rather than deriving it, so the two could
drift and nothing would have said which was right — a shell entered with one
list while `env -i` searched another. `Str::substr` and `operator==` are both
`constexpr`, so one `static_assert` on the word after `PATH=` makes that a
compile error. It is checked: reverting the constant alone fails the build in
`boot.cpp` rather than passing the tests.

**The smoke test builds a generation the way `gen_ops` emits one** — absolute
targets, `/pkg/bin` to `/pkg/active/bin` to `/pkg/gen/1/bin` — and plants a real
binary in the store rather than a fourth symlink, since a store directory holds
a program. What it then proves is that the resolution is the kernel's: `hi` runs
with no `PATH` set by hand, and so do `timeout hi` and `sh -c 'hi'`. It also
pins the two rules that make the arrangement safe rather than merely working.
`/bin` wins for a name in both, checked with `wc` rather than `echo`, which is a
builtin and would have shadowed the pair of them. And **`PATH` is a default and
not a floor**: `PATH=/home hi` is 127, so a process handed a `PATH` searches
that list alone, installed programs included — which is what a `PATH` that
steers resolution has to mean.

**`/pkg` survives a version change**, beside the `/bin/keepme` that proves the
opposite for `/bin`. The unpack names only the top-level directories the archive
carries, and Package_Management.md §6 already leans on that from the other end
to say the trust anchor is re-pinned at every release. Read forwards it says a
release replaces the system and leaves what `pkg` installed standing.

## A generation, as a list of steps

P11 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `db.cpp` is
Package_Formats.md §8 — the paths under `/pkg`, §8.2's two text files, and what
committing a generation *is*. `store.cpp` is the half that goes and does it.

**The split is the only way any of it could be tested.** `tests.wasm` cannot
supply `sys`/`sys_async` and is not allowed to: `braam_proc` is deliberately not
linked, so a syscall in a source compiled into the suite is a link error. A
`db.cpp` written as a coroutine that walks and writes would have put the commit
order — the one part of this that must not be got wrong — where nothing could
look at it until P18. So the ordering is a value: `gen_ops` returns the eight
steps, `store_perform` runs them, and the test compares the list against the one
§8.3 now spells out.

**Two things in the tree already work this way**, which is why it is not an
invention. `installOps` in `web/fs.js` is "what installing an archive *is*, as
operations for the caller to perform: OPFS awaits each one and the test fake
does them synchronously, and neither has its own idea of what the archive
means". And `test` is cut the same way for the same reason — `cond_probes`
names every file primary in one walk, `cond_eval` reads the answers back, and
`condrun.cpp` is the half that has to go and look. `db.cpp`/`store.cpp` is that
pair with the halves named for what they are rather than for the syscall.

**What is left unproven, and by how much.** `store.cpp` has no test, because no
subcommand reaches the store yet and the in-wasm suite cannot run a program.
What makes that tolerable is that it is a switch with nothing in it: each op is
one `proc/io.h` call the smoke test already covers through a program of its own
— `make_dir_all` through `mkdir -p`, `remove_path` through `rm -r`, `make_link`
through `ln -s`, `rename_path` through `mv`, and the open/write/close through
`edit`. There is no logic left in `store.cpp` to be wrong about, and P18 is what
gives it a caller and `test/run.mjs` a way in.

**The links are absolute, and the reader takes either.** A relative target would
buy a `/pkg` that could be moved, and nothing will move it: `/pkg` is a fixed
top-level name in Concept.md §5.1, and the kernel's default `PATH` names it by
that name at P12. What absolute buys instead is that `ls -l` shows the same
string the code wrote, which is worth more in a directory nobody can debug with
a package manager. `gen_of` is liberal anyway and reads `gen/2` as readily as
`/pkg/gen/2`, because P12's test builds that link by hand and a link put there
by a person is still a link.

**`Err(Unsupported)` from the commit rename is a failure, not an instruction.**
`rename_path`'s contract says the store may refuse to move a directory or a name
across mounts and that the caller should copy instead — `mv` is built on that.
It does not apply here: `/pkg/active.new` is a symlink beside its own
destination, so a refusal is a broken store rather than a hint, and treating it
as one would turn the single atomic step this whole arrangement exists for into
a copy that can be interrupted half-way.

**A missing file reads as an empty one.** `world` and `repositories` are absent
until something writes them, and the alternative — seeding them when the tree is
made — puts a `/pkg/repositories` with nothing in it on disk to mean what its
absence already meant. §8.2 gained the sentence. The same paragraph settles
that a last line without a newline is still a line, which is §9's rule about
apk's dropped final stanza applied to a second file format.

**The writer sorts.** §8.2 says `packages` is sorted by name, and P9 settled
that order is the writer's concern so that a round trip is defined; so
`packages_write` sorts rather than trusting a caller who will be handed the
solver's output in dependency order. It is an insertion sort over indices, which
is the right algorithm for a list as long as the number of packages a person has
installed.

## A second reader of one format, and the ceiling only it can see

P10 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the last Phase C
primitive. `zip.cpp` is Package_Formats.md §5.2 — the end record found behind its
comment, the central directory walked, each entry's data found by re-reading its
*local* header — and §5.1's dot-entry split. `unzip.cpp` is the twenty lines
that put an entry through `Sys::Inflate`.

**The module splits in two so that the rules can be tested at all.**
`test/CMakeLists.txt` compiles pkg's pure sources straight into `tests.wasm` and
does not link `braam_pkg`; a syscall in one of them is a link error, and that
link error is the assertion. Everything in §5.2 is arithmetic over a byte
buffer, so `zip.cpp` joins that list beside `stanza.cpp`, and only the
`inflate()` loop is exiled to `unzip.cpp`. Had it been one file, every rule the
task exists to pin down would have lived where the unit suite cannot reach it,
and the test would have re-implemented them — the same two-readers failure one
level down.

**The ceiling is on the pure side for the same reason.** `Sys::Inflate` caps its
input at `SYS_STAGE_MAX` and not its output, and answers with a descriptor
rather than a buffer, precisely so a bomb can be abandoned part way — but
nothing below `pkg` knows how big the entry claimed to be. So `ZipSink` holds
the declared size and refuses the chunk that would pass it, and a clean end of
stream short of it is `Err(Invalid)` and never a short read. It is thirty lines
in `zip.cpp`, tested directly, and the two loops that feed it — `unzip.cpp`'s
over `read_chunk`, the test's over `stream_read` — carry no policy between them.
The two halves even spell the end of a stream differently, `Err(Closed)` against
an empty chunk, which is a second reason not to have one loop pretending to
serve both.

**The declared size is trusted and the stream is not.** That sentence is the
whole of the rule, and it holds because the size comes out of an archive whose
digest has already been checked against a signed index (Package_Management.md
§7) while the inflated bytes come out of a decompressor. §5.2 gained it, along
with the `SYS_STAGE_MAX` ceiling on an entry's *compressed* size, which is a
real limit: an entry `pkg` cannot stage is one it cannot read, and refusing is
the only honest answer.

**`web/fs.js` did not move, and the document says why.** `parseZip` never reads
the uncompressed size at `+24`, and three lines would have made the two readers
identical. It stays as it is: `DecompressionStream` hands back a buffer, so the
check could only run once the bomb had been materialised, defending nothing —
and the one archive it reads is the release's own, packed by `tools/pack.py`
three lines away. The package reader reads archives it did not build. §5.2 now
records the asymmetry as an exception with its reasoning, so the next person to
diff the two does not "fix" one of them.

**§5.2's bullets became an order rather than a list.** Writing the second reader
turned up two places where the prose did not say enough to reproduce the first:
`parseZip` skips a name ending in `/` *before* it checks the name, so `../` is
skipped and not refused, and it judges the method *after* the local header has
been found. Both were accidents of the order the JS happens to be written in,
and both are now normative — a reader that reorders them refuses archives the
other accepts, which is exactly the class of disagreement §5.2 exists to
prevent.

**The archive comes along to the unit suite now.** `rootfs.zip` was already
passed to `smoke` so the packer and the unpacker check each other; it is passed
to `unit` for the same reason one level up. `test/run.mjs` plants the raw bytes
and a `<name> <size> <sha256>` manifest built from `parseZip`'s own output into
the fake store, and `test_zip` mounts `OpfsFs`, parses the same bytes in wasm,
inflates all 43 entries through the kernel's own service and compares every
digest. A single wrong byte in one entry fails it by name. The manifest is
digests rather than bytes so that 812 KiB of archive is never held twice.

The rest is fixtures: a zip builder in C++ with the fields a refusal needs to
lie about, since `tools/pack.py` always deflates, writes no directory entry and
no extra field — so **the local-header re-read, the bug §5.2 calls the classic
one, is invisible in `rootfs.zip`** and provable only against an archive built
to expose it. An entry whose local header carries seven bytes of extra field
that the central record does not is the whole case, and a reader that trusted
the central offset lands seven bytes into the data.

**No new command, so nothing in `/share/help` moved**, and `bin/pkg` did not
grow: nothing in `pkg.cpp` references `zip_read` yet, so `--gc-sections` drops
both members and the staging tree is where it was. P18 is what will link them.

## Size stops being a headline

The budgets stay; the noise around them goes. `tools/size_budget.txt` still
names 262,144 bytes for `kernel.wasm` and 1 MiB for the staging tree, the
kernel's `POST_BUILD` still checks the first, and the `size` case still checks
both. What changed is everything written *around* that check.

**CLAUDE.md led with it.** "Four things must never regress" named the two
numbers before it named the wasm ABI, which puts a byte count above the
interface every part of the system is written against. It names two things now.
The `size` bullet lost "raising a number is a deliberate act" — the budget
file's own comment says that, and saying it twice made it a rule about conduct
rather than a line in a config.

**§4.4 was arithmetic with a shelf life.** The duplication argument is the
durable part: no dynamic linking, so every binary carries its own allocator,
string types and coroutine runtime, so keep the process-side runtime minimal and
push anything substantial into a syscall. "~710 KiB over thirty-six binaries,
and `sh.wasm` is 214 KiB of it" was true when it was written and is not now. So
went README.md's "the kernel is 148 KB" in both places, Programming_Manual.md's
6 KB hello, and System_Calls.md's "~400 KB where four binaries once cost 47 KB".

This finishes an argument the file has already made twice. M3 raised the ceiling
from 32 KiB to 256 KiB and recorded that "a ceiling that has to be raised every
milestone measures nothing". Writing System_Calls.md took the exact counts out
of README.md and CLAUDE.md because "a pinned figure in a living document is
stale by the next one" — and replaced them with *rounder* pinned figures, which
went stale on schedule. The remedy is not a better number; it is no number.

**P28 of the `pkg` TODO lost its first half.** It told whoever writes `pkg` to
measure it against the budget and to justify raising the `rootfs/` line in this
file. If the staging tree ever exceeds 1 MiB the `size` case says so at the
moment it happens, and nobody needs telling in advance to worry about it. P28 is
documentation now.

**What did not move.** The 512-byte coroutine frame and the 64 KiB span behind
it are mechanism rather than budget — cited from some two dozen source comments,
and the reason `FS_BLOCK` and `SYS_CHUNK` are what they are. `SYS_STAGE_MAX`,
the 16 MB process cap, the package and index caps in the `pkg` documents and the
runtime storage quota are protocol limits. CI still reports every binary into
the job summary under `--report`, measured and not bounded. And the milestone
entries below stand as written: the figures they quote are a dated snapshot,
which is what this file is for.

## One reader, five files — and a `Field` that was already taken

P9 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the end of Phase C.
`stanza.cpp` is Package_Formats.md §1: a line is a letter, a colon and a value;
an empty line or end of file ends a stanza. Over it sit the typed records §2,
§3, §4 and §8.1 define, and the writer that puts a `/pkg/db` record back
byte-identically.

**The typed records land together rather than with their consumers.** P13 wants
the anchor, P14 the index header, P18 a package stanza, P11 the installed-db
record — four tasks, and writing four readers is exactly what §1 was written to
prevent. What makes one reader possible is that a letter means one thing in
every file, so the only per-file thing is *which* letters are allowed. That is
one `Str` of known letters passed to the reader, and the five of them sit
together in `stanza.h` where they can be read down a column.

**`Unusable` and `Malformed` are different because their scopes are.** §1 says
an unknown uppercase letter makes the *record* unusable — that record, not the
file — and scopes nothing else. The reader takes the silence seriously: a
repeated letter outside the accumulating six, and a line that is not a field at
all, take the file down, because a file whose framing cannot be trusted has no
records to salvage. §1 gained the case the code could not avoid answering: a
*known* letter whose value does not parse, or a required field that is absent,
is the record's problem and not the file's, on the same reasoning.

**§3.3 said two things that could not both be true**, and one of them is now
gone: the writer emits `C P V S I T o t k g D p i`, `C` first, and the document
also said a reader requires only that `P` come first. Order is the writer's
concern, so that a round trip is defined; a reader requires none. §8.1 gained
the same sentence, since it had no order written down at all and its round trip
is the criterion.

**The example digest in §1.1 was not a digest.** It was 43 base64 characters
where a padded 32-byte value needs 44, so §1.1's own rule refused the example
under it. It is now the `Q2` digest of the word `braam`, which decodes. Nothing
had noticed because nothing had ever parsed one.

### The bug that cost the most: two `Field`s

`StanzaField` is called that because `src/cmd/sh/expand.h` already has a
`struct Field` — an expanded shell word, 28 bytes, with a `String` and a `Vec`
in it. A stanza field is 12 bytes, a `char` and a `Str`, trivially copyable.
Both were at global scope, so **`Vec<Field>` was one mangled symbol over two
layouts**, `Vec<Field>::reserve` a weak definition the linker picked one of, and
the shell's — element size 28, non-trivial move, non-trivial destroy — is what
ran over `pkg`'s 12-byte elements. One element per growth came out with a
mangled pointer.

It presented as anything but an ODR violation. It vanished at `-O2` and
appeared at `-Os`, because the two levels inline `reserve` differently and
whether the shared symbol is called at all depends on that. It vanished when
the vector was reserved up front, because then nothing grows. The allocator
was provably not handing out overlapping blocks. The assembly for
`StanzaReader::next`, for the same loop written by hand, and for
`Vec<Field>::reserve` in `stanza.cpp` all read as correct — because they were:
the wrong one was in another object file.

**The rule this leaves: a type name at namespace scope must be unique across
the whole tree.** There are no namespaces here, `Vec<T>` and `Task<T>` mangle
their argument's name into a weak symbol, and `--gc-sections` with comdat
resolves the collision silently. `grep -rn "^struct <Name>" src/` before adding
one costs nothing; not doing it cost a session.

## `mkdir -p`, and the walk it is made of

`Sys::MkDir` creates one level and refuses a leaf that already exists, so until
now nothing in the system could build a path from nothing: `boot.cpp`'s
`make_dirs` is a fixed list of two names, `web/fs.js`'s `installOps` open-codes
the walk on the host side, and P11 of [pkg's TODO](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md) was
going to have to write a third copy for `/pkg/gen/<N>/…`. `-p` on `/bin/mkdir`
is the same walk, so it is written once, as `make_dir_all` in `src/proc/io.cpp`,
and `pkg` is its second caller rather than its author.

**The walk is userland, not a flag on the syscall.** `Sys::MkDir` has a flags
word going spare and a recursive bit would have been two lines in `vfs_mkdir`,
which is the argument against it: the kernel would then own a loop that can fail
half-way, and the partial tree it left behind would be a kernel decision rather
than a program's. Nothing about the walk needs privilege, the components are
independent syscalls either way, and the ABI does not move. A program that wants
different behaviour on a component that already stands — refusing, or asking —
writes its own loop over `make_dir`, which is still there.

**The prefixes are textual, on the path as written.** No `cwd_get`, no
`path_resolve`: a prefix of a relative path is relative and resolves against the
same cwd, `.` drops on the way past, and `..` reaches the VFS which already
normalises it. That is one syscall per component and not one more, and it is why
`mkdir -p r/s/t` needs nothing that `mkdir -p /a/b/c` does not.

**`Error::Exists` is tolerated rather than pre-empted.** Statting each component
first would double the syscalls on the common path — most of a `/pkg/gen/<N>`
already exists — to learn what the `mkdir` is about to say anyway. The cost of
try-then-tolerate is that `Exists` does not say *what* stands there, and for an
intermediate that does not matter: a file part-way along fails the component
below it, with that component named. It matters for the leaf, where `mkdir -p f`
over a regular file would otherwise report success, so the leaf alone is
statted, and only when the whole path turned out to be there already. One extra
syscall in the case that did no work at all.

## A dependency is a name and a bitfield

P8 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the last Phase C
primitive. `dep.cpp` is Package_Formats.md §6: `[!]name[[op]ver]`, and the
space- or newline-separated list of them that `D:`, `p:`, `i:` and `/pkg/world`
carry. It is `apk_dep_parse` and `apk_blob_pull_dep` with the database interning
taken out — a name here is a `Str` into whoever owns the text, the way `Args`
views argv.

**Nothing in it knows how many operators there are.** `<`, `>`, `=` and `~` each
contribute bits to a mask, a comparison answers exactly one bit, and a
dependency is satisfied when that bit is in the mask. So `foo<=1.2` needs no
case, `foo>~1.2` needs no case, and `!foo` is the same machinery with an
inversion at the end. The whole parser is: strip a `!`, take the name up to the
first operator character, take the maximal run of them, and the rest is a
version. Nine spellings, one code path, and the count nine appears nowhere.

**That is also why `><` needed no decision.** apk reads that spelling as a
checksum comparison and §9 dropped it. Dropping it took no code: `>` and `<`
contribute their bits, the mask means LESS or GREATER, and `foo><1.2` reads as
"any version but this one". A parser with nine cases would have had to grow a
tenth to say what happens; a bitfield has nowhere for a spelling to be missing
from.

**Broken and malformed are different answers because they have different
consequences.** §6 already said an unparseable version marks the dependency
broken rather than failing the file — the stanza becomes an uninstallable
package and every other stanza still reads. It said nothing about a token with
no name at all, or an operator with nothing after it. Those are not broken
dependencies; they are a field that is not a dependency list, and a reader that
treated `=1.2` as "a dependency on the empty name that nothing satisfies" would
turn a corrupt file into a package that merely cannot be installed. So
`dep_parse` answers `Ok`, `Broken` or `Malformed`, and §6 gained the sentence
that says which is which. apk makes the same split, as `-APKE_PKGVERSION_FORMAT`
against `-APKE_DEPENDENCY_FORMAT`.

`Dep::broken` is a field *as well as* a return value, which is apk's shape and
looks redundant. It is what makes `dep_satisfied` safe: a reader that kept a
broken dependency to report it later can still ask whether a candidate
satisfies it and get `false`, without every call site remembering to check the
parse result first.

`VER_CONFLICT` lands in `version.h` rather than `dep.h`, and the inversion
happens inside `version_match`, because that is where apk puts it and because
the alternative — inverting in `dep_satisfied` — would leave a mask that means
one thing to one caller and another to the next. The one thing it forced was
rewriting `version_match`'s early `return true` for `VER_ANY` into a value the
inversion applies to; without that, `!foo` would have matched everything.

## Versions, ported rather than designed

P7 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `version.cpp` is apk's
`src/version.c` — the token grammar of Package_Formats.md §7, the suffix table
with `none` as its pivot, and a comparison that answers a bit rather than a
sign. `test/unit/version.data` is apk's fixture file and
`test/unit/test_version.cpp` is its loop; all 785 cases pass.

**The interesting decision is that there was no decision.** A version
comparison looks like the sort of thing to write freshly and simply — split on
dots, compare numbers — and every such attempt is wrong in the same places.
`1.07 < 1.1` because a run with a leading zero sorts as a string, and it is a
*string* even when the other side has no leading zero. `1.1_alpha1 < 1.1`
because a pre-release suffix makes the longer version the smaller one, which no
lexicographic or field-wise rule produces. `2.3.0b` orders after `2.3.0` but
before `2.3.1`. Package_Formats.md §9 already froze the grammar for the sake of
this file and `test/solver/`'s fixtures; P7 is what that freeze was for.

**The token-type ordering is the whole algorithm.** The nine token kinds are an
enum whose *numeric order* is load-bearing twice over: `token_next` validates a
transition by comparing the previous token against a bound (a letter after a
suffix is invalid because `LETTER` is not greater than `DIGIT`), and the tail of
the comparison, once the shared prefix matches, decides by which side's next
token has the higher number — the higher number being the *lesser* version,
because `END` is 7 and everything that can still follow is below it. Reordering
that enum would silently change what a version means.

**Two behaviours are apk's and are kept although they look like bugs.** A digit
run is pulled as a `u64` and wraps rather than failing, and two versions that
both go invalid at the same token index compare *equal*. Both fall out of the C
the fixtures were written against. A port that "fixed" either would pass fewer
of them, and the fixtures are the specification.

**The fixture is data, not a rewritten table.** `version.data` is byte-for-byte
apk's with `R"DATA(` prepended and `)DATA"` appended — two lines, so a reader
can diff it against upstream and the test compiles it in without a build step.
`tests.wasm` cannot open a host file, and a generated header would have been a
script, a custom command and a dependency edge for the same 12 KB of text. What
the wrapper buys is that nobody retypes 785 comparisons: a rewritten table is a
table with new mistakes in it.

`version_mask` and `version_match` land here rather than in P8 because the
fixture's line format is `ver1 op ver2` and running it needs them. The mask is
also the shape P8 was written around — an operator is a set of acceptable
results, so nine spellings collapse into one `match()` and a bitfield. apk's
conflict bit waits for the dependency that carries it.

## A digest that streams, and two decoders that refuse

P6 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md). `sha256.cpp` is FIPS 180-4
with an init/update/finish shape, `encode.cpp` is hex and base64 in both
directions, and both are pure enough to compile straight into `tests.wasm`
beside the shell's grammar — `braam_pkg` is not linked there, so a syscall in
either would be a link error.

**The digest streams because the host's cannot.** `crypto.subtle.digest` is
one-shot: it takes a whole buffer and answers once. Asking the host for a
package's hash would mean staging the package through `SYS_STAGE_MAX`, which
caps a package at a megabyte and puts the whole of it across the ABI at the
moment `pkg` is least sure of it — a body it has not yet checked. Concept.md §6
already refused it on those grounds; what P6 adds is the shape that makes the
refusal cheap. `update()` takes whatever came off the fetch descriptor, so
P18's step 2 hashes and writes the same chunk and nothing accumulates.

**The context is 112 bytes and says so in its header.** A `Sha256` in a
coroutine frame is a fifth of the 512-byte budget a frame has before it costs a
whole 64 KiB span, and the coroutine that wants one is the loop reading a body,
which is exactly the long-lived frame. So the header says where it goes: the
heap record the read already needs, not the frame.

**The encoders write into the caller's buffer.** Every value `pkg` encodes has
a size known before it starts — 32 bytes of digest, 32 of public key, 64 of
signature — so `hex_size`/`base64_size` are `constexpr`, a caller declares an
array of exactly that, and the module allocates nothing. Returning a `String`
would have been shorter at each call site and would have put a failure that
cannot happen (a heap that cannot find 44 bytes) on the path where a digest is
compared.

**Both decoders refuse rather than normalise, and the tail-bit rule is the
point.** A base64 group that yields fewer than three bytes has bits no byte
carries. A decoder that ignores them accepts `Zg==` and `Zh==` as the same
byte — and Package_Formats.md §2 matches a key's name by *recomputing* it, so
two spellings of one name is two ways to be the key the anchor trusts. The
check is one mask and it is the difference between a name and a label.
Whitespace is not skipped and `=` is not tolerated anywhere but the end for the
same reason: every relaxation is another spelling. Nothing partial comes back —
a rejection is `None`, never a count with garbage behind it.

**Hex is here although no format uses it.** Package_Formats.md is base64
throughout. Hex is what a person types when they pin a key by fingerprint
(Package_Management.md §6), and what a test vector is written in — which is
immediately its second job: `test_svc.cpp` had a private `unhex` for the RFC
8032 vectors, and it is now the same decoder, under the same rule about two
readers of one encoding that P10 states about the zip.

## `/bin/pkg`, which knows its own names and nothing else

P5 of [src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md](../src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md), and the first Phase C task.
`pkg` is a binary in the archive, `src/cmd/pkg/` is a directory beside
`src/cmd/sh/`, and `braam_pkg` is a static library the binary links with
`main.cpp` outside it. It carries a table of its eleven subcommand names and a
dispatch over it. Nothing behind any of them: no network, no digest, no `/pkg`
tree, and the default `PATH` is still `/bin`.

**A directory before there is anything to put in it.** Every other program in
`src/cmd/` is one translation unit, and the shell earned its directory by being
a grammar, an expander, a line editor and twenty-six builtins. `pkg` has none of
that yet, so the shape is being chosen ahead of the code rather than discovered
by it — which is the point. What P6 to P28 add is a digest, a version grammar,
a stanza reader, a zip reader, a signature pipeline and a solver, each with a
test of its own, and every one of them wants to be a translation unit that
`main.cpp` does not see. Starting one-file and splitting later would have meant one commit
that moves everything and no test able to name a piece before then. The library
also settles what `pkg` may reach: it links `braam_proc`, so nothing in it can
touch a kernel header that pulls in the scheduler, the same fence `braam_sh`
lives behind.

**The table is explicit and carries no prose.** Explicit for
`builtin/table.cpp`'s reason — `--gc-sections` never extracts an unreferenced
archive member, so anything self-registering would be dropped without a word.
No prose for the other of that file's reasons: what a command is *for* belongs
in `/share/help`, and a description compiled into the binary is a second copy to
go stale. The usage text's list of command names is generated from the table for
the same reason, so a row added by P15 cannot drift from what `pkg` prints.

**An unbuilt command answers 1, an unknown one answers 2.** Both could have been
a usage error, and collapsing them would have been simpler by a branch. They are
kept apart because they are different facts: `pkg nonesuch` is a typo and the
usage line is the useful reply, while `pkg install` is a correctly spelled
command this build does not have yet, which is not a usage error and printing
usage for it would say the word was wrong. It also gives `test/run.mjs` a way to
assert that the table is real rather than that the binary refuses everything —
`pkg install braam` reporting 1 and `pkg nonesuch` reporting 2 is the whole
difference between a dispatch and a stub. Each later task turns one null into a
function and the exit code changes with it.

**`/share/help` describes what `pkg` will do, not what it does.** The line is
`install and remove packages`, phrased for the finished command, because the
smoke test requires every shipped binary to be named there exactly once and a
line that has to be rewritten as the commands land is a line that will be
forgotten. What the build actually has is what `pkg` itself says when run.

## A decompressor that hands back a stream, not a buffer

`Sys::Inflate` is op 58 and `SvcOp::Inflate` is 20; `PROC_ABI` moves to 16. Raw
deflate goes in as one staged payload and a descriptor comes back, so `Read` and
`Close` serve it as they serve a fetched body. With `Verify` before it, Phase B
of `src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md` is done and `/bin/pkg` has everything it needs from the
host.

**The host hands back a reader, and `OP.READ` did not change at all.**
`web/svc.js` already builds `{reader, left, done}` for a fetch body and
`readBody` pulls chunks from it; a `DecompressionStream` gives a reader with the
same contract, so the new arm is three lines and `OP.READ` and `OP.DROP` are
untouched — `DROP` already cancels a reader that never reached its end. The
alternative was to inflate eagerly into one JS buffer, which is what
`web/fs.js` does for the boot archive and would have been fewer lines here too.
**It is the wrong shape for a package manager.** A megabyte of compressed input
is allowed to become a gigabyte, and a caller that streams can stop when the
zip's own header says it has had enough, where a caller handed a finished buffer
is told about the bomb only after it has gone off. The bound belongs where the
caller can enforce it.

**`Handle::Kind::Inflate` shares `Kind::Body`'s storage, which is not the
compromise it looks like.** `Handle` holds every payload as a plain member
rather than a union, so a `JsHandle` of its own would have grown every
descriptor in the system to serve one kind; reusing `HttpResponse` costs
nothing and leaves `status` and `headers` zero. Reusing `Kind::Body` *itself*
would have cost even less — no new arms anywhere — and was rejected because the
tag would then be lying about what the descriptor is, which is the sort of thing
that reads fine until someone prints it. What did get renamed is `http_read`,
now `stream_read`: it never named anything but `SvcOp::Read` on a slot, and the
HTTP was in the name alone.

**Two failure modes are asymmetric, and one of them is worth knowing about.**
`Handle::shut()`'s switch is over a scoped enum with no `default`, so a kind
without an arm is a compile error. `Sys::Read`'s chain starts at
`r = Err(Error::Perm)` and falls through, so a kind without a branch is a silent
runtime refusal — which is why the read path is the one the tests actually walk.

**Where a truncated stream fails is deliberately unspecified.** A browser
delivers the chunks it already had and fails the read that reaches the damage;
`test/fakesvc.mjs`, whose `perform` must answer synchronously and so uses
`node:zlib`'s `inflateRawSync`, fails the `Inflate` itself. Both are errors and
neither is a clean end of stream, so that is what the guarantee says and what
the test asserts. Pinning the timing would have written the fake's shape into
the contract.

**The tests are two vectors and a cut.** One inflates to 65 bytes and fits a
single `SYS_CHUNK`; one inflates to 1500 and takes three, which is the only
thing that proves the read loop runs — a single-chunk bug returns 512 and looks
like success otherwise. Both were checked by sabotage: returning the input
uninflated fails them with 10 and 19 bytes, and deleting the fake's arm fails
them with none. `kernel.wasm` grew 1,318 bytes, to 175,061 of 262,144.

## A signature check, and a refusal that cannot be mistaken for a pass

`Sys::Verify` is op 57 and `SvcOp::Verify` is 19: Ed25519 over
`crypto.subtle.verify`, an enum value on each side of the one `host_svc` import
rather than an import of its own. `PROC_ABI` moves to 15. It is the first code
`/bin/pkg` needs and the load-bearing one — every other check in
[Package_Management.md](Package_Management.md) §7 assumes a signature was
checked first.

**The boolean lives in one place, and everything below it refuses.** A bad
signature is `-Error::Perm` on the wire, a failed `Result` in the kernel, and a
`false` only once it reaches `verify_sig` in `src/proc/io.h`. The alternative
was a status of 1 for good and 0 for bad, which reads better at a call site and
fails in the wrong direction: a caller that ignored the value would take a bad
signature for a good one. This way the slip is `CO_TRY_VOID` on something that
returns a value — visibly wrong — and the default behaviour of every layer that
does not know about `Verify` is to refuse. **A program still gets a `bool`**,
because the layer that has to tell "this signature is bad, try the next `Y:`
line" from "this browser has no Ed25519, stop" is the one that would otherwise
have to special-case `Perm` by hand at every call.

**Where the algorithm is missing, `Err(Unsupported)` must not look like a check
that failed.** `web/svc.js` catches a `NotSupportedError` and rethrows it as
`E.UNSUPPORTED`, because `statusOf` would otherwise map an unrecognised
exception to `E.IO` — an error either way, but not the one §8 attaches a rule
to. The property was tested by deletion rather than asserted: removing the arm
from `test/fakesvc.mjs` makes every vector fail, the good ones because they no
longer verify and the bad ones because the error is the wrong kind. A suite that
went green with the crypto gone would have proved nothing.

**The fake verifies for real, and synchronously.** `test/fakesvc.mjs` answers
from inside the import, which is what lets a unit test drive a whole `co_await`
chain in one `sched_tick` — there is no drain loop in the unit suite, so an arm
that parked could never be answered at all. `crypto.subtle` is a promise, so the
fake uses `node:crypto`'s synchronous `verify` over the raw key wrapped in
Ed25519's twelve-byte SPKI header. Two implementations of one check is the
opposite of what this codebase usually wants, and it is right here: the fake is
not a stand-in for the real verifier, it *is* a verifier, so RFC 8032's vectors
are checked rather than a canned answer being replayed.

**The lengths are refused before the host is asked.** 32 bytes of key and 64 of
signature, from `SYS_ED25519_KEY` and `SYS_ED25519_SIG` — constants rather than
something the payload states, since §8 is one algorithm and no negotiation.
Anything else is `Err(Invalid)`, which also keeps a malformed anchor from
reaching WebCrypto at all.

**Being one staged payload caps what can be signed at `SYS_STAGE_MAX`.** A
signature over bytes the kernel fetched separately would be a signature over
whichever bytes arrived last, so key, signature and message are staged together
and the 1 MiB ceiling follows. That is a real bound on how large a signed index
may be, and it belongs in the record now rather than being discovered when the
fetch cap is written.

**57 landed with no caller in `src/cmd/`.** The note written two commits ago
said `Sys` would gain each reserved number with its caller, and that has been
rewritten rather than left standing: §4.3's rule bars *growing* the table on
speculation, and a row specified, reviewed and committed before a line of it was
written is not a guess. `Cursor` and `Style` have no caller either, and the reference has
said so for some time. `kernel.wasm` grew 1,402 bytes, to 173,743 of 262,144.

## Five formats, frozen before a parser exists

[Package_Formats.md](Package_Formats.md) defines one stanza grammar and the five
files over it. It is a reference and reads like one; this is what it leaves out.

**A document of its own, not a section of the policy.** Package_Management.md's
§7 to §11 are cited by number all through `src/cmd/pkg/TODO.md`, so a new
numbered section would have renumbered four of them, and an appendix would have
put the grammar behind eleven sections of argument about keys. The split is also
the honest one: the policy says what must be true, the format says what the
bytes are, and the two change for different reasons.

**apk's field letters are kept unchanged, and that is the whole design
constraint.** `test/unit/version.data` is 788 comparison cases and
`test/solver/` is 119 test files over 29 repository files, all in plain APKINDEX
text. They port as *data* while the letters and the version grammar match and
become a rewriting job the moment they do not — and a rewritten table is a table
with new mistakes in it. Every temptation to improve a letter was measured
against that and lost. What is dropped is only what has nothing to name here:
`A` because there is one architecture, `so:` because every binary is statically
linked, `@tag` because there is one repository, `><` because the index already
names a package by its hash.

**One letter means one thing across all five files.** apk reuses them freely —
`I` is an installed size in the index and unused in the installed database, `R`
is a regular file in one and absent from the other — and gets away with it
because a single switch statement reads both. Assigning them globally costs a
few less mnemonic choices and buys a table that can be checked by reading down
one column, which is the kind of checking that actually gets done.

**A signature is inline, and the signed region is one rule.** The block is the
first stanza of the file and **the signed bytes are everything after the first
empty line**. A detached `.sig` would have made the region plainer still — it is
the whole file — but at the cost of a second fetch and a second thing to
withhold, and "the whole package set, signed as one file" reads more literally
when it is one file. The risk taken is the parser differential: a signer and a
checker that compute that offset differently produce a signature over bytes
nobody agreed on. It is one rule, stated once, and `tools/signindex.py` is
required to compute it the way `pkg` does — which is why P26 now says so.

**The index's header stanza is an invention, and the document says so.** apk has
no index version and no expiry at all: staleness there is a client-side check of
the cached file's mtime against a four-hour default, and `DESCRIPTION` is a
free-form blob capped at 160 bytes with no keys in it. Package_Management.md §7
requires both a version that only goes up and an expiry, so there was nothing
upstream to copy and this is the part with no second opinion available. `N`, the
repository's own URL inside the signed region, is the piece that is easy to
forget: without it an index published for one repository is a valid index for
every other.

**A package's URL is derived, never carried.** §4 of the policy already says a
redirect is invisible and the URL a package came from proves nothing — a package
is named by its hash. A field naming a URL could then only be a second place for
the same fact to be wrong, and it would be the field an attacker edits.

**Metadata is a top-level dot-entry, because a zip has no order to rely on.**
apk's control section works by being an ordered prefix of a tar; a zip is read
through its central directory, which promises no order at all, so the split had
to be a name. Making it a *path* — a name with no slash in it, beginning with a
dot — also makes it structurally impossible for a package to install a file
where its own metadata lives. **An unknown dot-entry refuses the package**,
where apk ignores unknown control files: a package carrying an instruction this
`pkg` cannot read must not be half-installed, and that is the uppercase rule
applied to an entry name.

**Two departures are about the absence of things.** The installed database keeps
`F:`/`R:`/`Z:` and drops `M:` and `a:`, which carry uid, gid, mode and an xattr
digest — a field that could only ever be written `0:0:644` invites someone to
believe it means something. And end of file commits a stanza, where apk drops a
last stanza that has no trailing blank line. That is silent data loss at the one
place these files are most likely to be edited by hand, and it costs a line to
avoid.

**One contradiction of P1's is fixed here.** `/pkg/gen/<N>` was described both
as a text file holding the installed set and as a directory holding the symlink
farm. It is a directory: `packages` is the text and `bin/` the farm, which is
what lets one rename of `/pkg/active` commit the two together.

## The decisions `/bin/pkg` cannot take back

[Package_Management.md](Package_Management.md) was written before the package
manager because a key made on a networked machine is never afterwards an offline
key. The development plan under `src/cmd/pkg/` opens with the same move for a
different reason: three of its decisions stop being decisions the moment code
embodies them, and one of them had already changed under it. This is that first
step — five documents amended, no code — and what follows is why each says what
it now says.

**Activation is symbolic links on `PATH`, and the kernel gains nothing.** The
plan was written when `/bin` was the whole of command resolution, and it
proposed a fourth clause in `exec_resolve`: on a miss, read `/pkg`'s record of
which generation is live, read that generation, take the line naming the
command. Three commits since — symbolic links, `Sys::Rename`, and `PATH` read
out of the environment a spawn carries — have between them made the clause pure
cost. A generation materialised as a directory of links into the store, named by
a `/pkg/bin` that the default search list mentions after `/bin`, is the same
activation with no kernel code at all, and the property that mattered survives
unchanged: `/bin` is searched first, so nothing installed can shadow the system.
What the clause would have bought instead is worth naming, because it is what
was given up: the kernel learning two of `/pkg`'s file formats, two file reads
on every failed lookup at a prompt, and four distinct ways of being
half-installed that each had to degrade into an ordinary "command not found"
rather than a boot that would not finish. **A rename is already the commit point a generation
wants**, which is the part that makes the trade lopsided rather than merely
favourable. Writing the new generation whole and then swinging one link over it
is Nix's arrangement, and a tab that dies before the swing has left rubbish a
`pkg clean` collects rather than a system half-upgraded.

**`/pkg` is a top-level directory the archive does not carry, which is §6 read
backwards.** The unpack replaces `bin` and `share` and names no other directory,
and Package_Management.md §6 leans on exactly that to guarantee the trust anchor
cannot be poisoned in the store for good: it is re-pinned from the archive at
every version change. The same sentence, read from the other end, says that
anything *not* in the archive survives a release — so the store, the
generations, and the links that activate one all keep. `PATH` reaching them
keeps too, because the default is a constant in the kernel and not a file
anybody can lose. A version change therefore replaces the system and leaves what
`pkg` installed standing, which is the arrangement that makes "a wipe is fixed
by reinstalling" true of `/bin` without being true of everything.

**SHA-256 moved into wasm; the signature check did not.** The two look like one
decision and are not. A signature check is a promise on the host side, which is
Concept.md §2.2's convention already, and the host is inside the trusted base
unconditionally — a host willing to lie about `crypto.subtle.verify` could
simply hand over a different `pkg.wasm`, so a verifier there widens nothing. A
digest is a different shape: `crypto.subtle.digest` wants the whole message, so
taking a package's hash on the host would mean staging every byte of it through
`SYS_STAGE_MAX`, and a megabyte cap on how large a package may be would have
been imposed by the shape of a syscall rather than by anything true about
packages. Hashing in wasm, off the fetch descriptor, a chunk at a time, costs a
few hundred bytes of `pkg` and nothing large ever crosses the boundary. **The
rule that a stream of bytes comes back as a descriptor cuts both ways**: what a
program can already read a chunk at a time, it can already digest a chunk at a
time, and the operation that would have been added was fighting that.

**`Inflate` answers with a descriptor because its output has no size to
declare.** Its input is one staged payload and is bounded by `SYS_STAGE_MAX`;
its output is bounded by nothing, since a compressed entry decides how much it
becomes. Capping the input and not the output is the asymmetry that makes the
operation worth having rather than a flaw in it — a bound is placed where the
caller can honour it and nowhere the format would get to choose. `Read` and
`Close` then serve the result exactly as they serve a fetched body, so no
operation is duplicated and a hundred-to-one entry costs one reply per chunk.
An entry too large to stage is refused and the bound is documented, which is the
alternative to a chunked `Inflate` that would have needed a session and a second
operation to end it.

**Two operation numbers are reserved in the reference before their code, and the
rule they bend is stated where they sit.** Concept.md §4.3 says every operation
has a caller in `src/cmd/`, and calls that a rule against growing the table on
speculation. `Verify` and `Inflate` are in System_Calls.md's table at 57 and 58,
and in neither `Sys` nor `SvcOp`, precisely so the rule keeps its teeth: nothing
in the tree can issue them, `PROC_ABI` is still 14, and no stamped binary has
been invalidated by a document. What the reservation buys is that the shape of
the two crossings a package manager can get wrong quietly — what a signature is
taken over, and what a decompressor is allowed to hand back — is settled and
reviewable before anything is written against it. The numbers themselves are
free real estate: the host-services group runs 48 to 56 and the terminal group
starts at 64, and sparse numbering was put there for this.

**§11's ban on install scripts was rewritten rather than kept, because it
forbade what nothing could enforce.** The old paragraph argued that a package
running code at install time is a package whose signature authorises arbitrary
execution rather than file contents. That argument is sound and its conclusion
still does not follow, for the reason §11's own first paragraph gives: there is
no privilege boundary here to put a script behind. OPFS stores no per-file mode,
every mount but `/proc` is the one read-write store, and `rm /bin/sh` already
works from a prompt. A fence drawn around a script would have been a drawing,
and the section that exists to disclaim guarantees the system does not have is
the last place to add one. So the paragraph now says what a script *is* — an
ordinary `/bin/sh` process with exactly the authority of whoever typed `pkg
install` — and what that costs, which is the whole of §11 brought within reach
of a signed package rather than only a mistaken one. **What it does not cost is
the rule the document was written for.** A script still runs only after its
package's hash matched a hash from a signed index, so the code that runs is the
publisher's and never the network's; the check moves nothing, it is what the
script's authority is traced back to. A repository that can rewrite a package
still cannot make one run. And a package that only places files runs nothing at
all, since `pkg` unpacks those itself from bytes it hashed, so the common case
keeps the stronger property.

## `help` is a document, and `less` is a `cat` off a terminal

`help` was the twenty-seventh builtin: it printed the table with a usage string
carried on every row, then walked `PATH` and decorated each name it found with a
line looked up in `/share/help`. Around a hundred lines of C++ and a `Str` field
per builtin, inside `sh.wasm` — nearly a third of the boot archive — to render a
list that changes when a program is added and at no other time. **What a command
is for is a document, not state**, and the shell had no business holding it: the
first clause of §4.5's rule is about the shell *process's own* state, and a
usage line is not that. So `/share/help` became the whole text, `/bin/help` is
`#!/bin/sh` over `less /share/help`, and `Builtin` lost its `usage` field along
with `builtins()`, which had no other caller. `sh.wasm` fell by 5,877 bytes and
`less.wasm` rose by 1,691 for the copy path below; with the document 2,622
bytes longer for the builtin lines it now carries, the staging tree came out
1,444 bytes smaller at 797,935.

**The document ships as one file, and that is the loss.** The old `help` listed
what the directories on `PATH` actually held, so a program dropped anywhere
appeared in it unasked. The new one lists what the archive ships. That is the
right trade for the system as it stands — the only way a name gets onto `PATH`
today is by hand — but it is `/bin/pkg`'s problem the moment packages install
programs: an installer will have to append to `/share/help`, or the file will
have to gain an "and whatever else is out there" section. Two smaller losses go
with it: `help <arg>` pages rather than answering with a usage line and 2, and a
name that is both a builtin and a file (`echo`, `test`, `[`, `true`, `false`)
now appears in both sections, where the builtin's listing deduplicated it. The
second is arguably better — the two entries say different things, one about what
a prompt runs and one about what a spawn gets.

**`less` had to learn the difference between a terminal and a pipe**, or
`help | grep ls` would have hung with an invisible pager holding the keyboard.
`Sys::Tty` already answers it and `ls` already asks, so the probe is `tty_of`
copied from `ls.cpp`; off a console `less` runs cat.cpp's chunk loop instead and
claims nothing. **It goes before the keyboard claim**, which is the whole of it:
a stage that will not page must not take the keys from one that will. That fixed
`less a | less b` too, which used to be a pager and a refusal and is now a copy
and a pager. The refusal is still worth a test, and `edit … | less` is what
reaches it now — `edit` claims the terminal whatever its output is, and asks
second because it opens its file first.

**The accuracy problem moved rather than vanished.** A generated listing could
not go stale; a document can, and nothing at run time notices. So `test/run.mjs`
checks the shipped `/share/help` against the builtin names in `table.cpp` and
the `bin/` entries of the archive it already unpacks: each named once, and
nothing named that is not there. The archive rather than the source tree,
because what ships is what a reader gets. It is the same discipline as the
exact-import assertion — a list that must not drift, asserted against the thing
it describes.

The worker pool's expected size moved from one to two with this, and that is a
real change rather than a fudged number: `help | cat` is four processes at once
— the shell, the script's interpreter, the pager it runs and `cat` — which is
the widest moment the smoke test ever reaches, and the pool grows to the widest
pipeline it has seen.

## A `/proc` size is a snapshot, and the test asked the wrong file

`test_procfs` checked that `vfs_stat` agrees with a read — what `ls -l`
promises — and asked it of `/proc/meminfo`. A `/proc` file has no stored size:
`ProcFs::stat` generates the text, measures it and throws it away, so the
answer describes the moment of the `stat`, not the moment of the read.
`/proc/meminfo` carries `allocs` and `frees`, which the intervening read moves
— it allocates a `String` and grows it — so the two texts differ in length
whenever a counter gains a digit between them. The check passed for as long as
it did by luck, and failed on CI once the suite's own allocation total drifted
onto a power of ten (71 bytes against 72).

The check is worth keeping, so it moved to `/proc/version`, whose text is a
build constant. Making `meminfo` stable was never an option: live counters are
what the file is for, and the alternative — caching the generated text between
`stat` and `open` — would buy a test a lie, since the two are separate calls
with a tick between them and nothing says the numbers should not have moved.
Linux answers 0 for every `/proc` size for the same reason; Braam answers the
true length of one snapshot instead, which is more useful and no more binding.

## `PATH`

"The environment crosses a spawn" below closed with the reason there was no
`PATH`: *"a `PATH` that did not steer resolution would be a lie a script could
believe."* That set the condition rather than the verdict, and this change meets
it. `/bin` was the only place a program could live, so anything built, unpacked
or fetched had to be copied there or typed with a slash.

**It went where resolution already was, which is the kernel.** The `/bin/`
prefix was a constant inside `exec_resolve` (`src/user/exec.cpp`), not something
the shell built — the shell hands `Sys::Spawn` the word as typed. So the
alternative was a shell that resolved words itself and spawned an absolute path,
and that would have made `PATH` exactly the lie the old paragraph warned about:
`timeout ls`, `watch ls`, a program's own `spawn()` and a `#!` script's children
would all still have looked in `/bin` alone, and the shell would have needed a
second copy of the "is this a program" test to boot. Instead `exec_resolve`
takes the environment blob the spawn is carrying and reads one word out of it.
Every spawn in the system steers by the same list, and `PATH=/x prog` steers the
very spawn its prefix names, because the child's blob is assembled before the
resolve.

**One word, and the kernel still does not read the rest.** `System_Calls.md`
said the kernel does not read the environment at all; that is now true of every
word but `PATH`. `env_value` and `env_path_next` went into `sysabi.h` beside
`argv_at` rather than into `exec.cpp`, because the shell's `command -v` and
`help` need the same two and a second implementation is how a rule drifts.
`proc_env` in `src/proc/rt.cpp` was that lookup already and is now a call to it.

**An empty component is skipped rather than meaning the current directory.**
v7's `::` and its leading `:` are a footgun with nothing to recommend them, and
there is no compatibility to keep here. An absent `PATH` means
`SYS_PATH_DEFAULT`, so `env -i ls` still runs and no existing spawn changed
behaviour; a `PATH` that is *there and empty* names no directories and finds
nothing. Those two had to be distinguishable, which is why `env_value` reports
presence through its return value and leaves the out-parameter alone.

**A file that is not a program does not shadow one behind it.** There are no
permissions and OPFS stores no mode, so "is it a program" is the only
executability test the system has; if a stray `notes` in an early component
stopped the search, `PATH` would be unusable for anything but a curated
directory. The search skips it and remembers, and reports `Err(Invalid)` — 126,
`not executable` — rather than `Err(NotFound)` if it found nothing better. That
is POSIX's found-but-not-executable rule, arrived at from the other direction.
`Err(Unsupported)`, a binary of ours built against another kernel, stops the
search instead: a stale-binary diagnostic is only a diagnostic if it survives.

**The cost is one failed open per miss.** A hit reads the image, which
resolution paid for anyway. Nothing bounds the component count but `SYS_ENV_MAX`
— 8192 bytes of environment — and a cap would be a number to argue about for a
case nobody has.

**The shell exports `PATH` whether or not it is asked to.** `var_set` marks it,
which is the one name in the table with a rule of its own. Without that,
`unset PATH; PATH=/x` would leave a variable that looks right, prints right and
steers nothing, since the kernel reads the *environment*. The mark is the
smallest thing that makes the variable mean what it says. Init plants
`PATH=/bin` beside `HOME` and `SHELL`, so `echo $PATH` answers and a script can
prepend to it.

**`command -v` is the twenty-seventh builtin, and the list is still closed.** It
qualifies under the first clause, not a new one: its answer *is* the shell
process's own state — the function table and the builtin table, which no syscall
shows anyone — so no program could give it. It walks `PATH` with the probe
`test -x` already used, lifted out of `condrun.cpp` as `file_runnable` so that
`test -x`, `command -v` and `help` cannot disagree. That probe checks the wasm
magic rather than the `braam` section, which is a divergence from the kernel
that predates this and is documented where it is.

**Only `-v`.** A bare `command <cmd>` means "run this with function lookup
suppressed", and suppression has to reach the per-stage resolution in
`exec_pipeline`; a builtin runs after that decision, not before it. Refused with
a usage line and 2 rather than half-implemented.

**`help` walks `PATH` too**, first directory naming something winning, because a
listing that still said `/bin` would be answering a question nobody asked any
more. It lists what the directories hold rather than what would run — as it
always did, since checking each entry would cost two round trips a name.

**It cost 971 bytes of kernel and 5,958 of `sh.wasm`** — the search itself is
small; the builtin and the `help` rewrite are most of the second number.

**`vmstat` grew two columns.** `al` and `fr` are adjacent with no gap, six wide,
and a run allocating past a hundred thousand times a second ran them together —
latent, and the new tests were what allocated enough to show it. Seven each; the
row is still inside eighty columns.

---

## `/bin/mv`, and a rename that sometimes cannot

Modelled on v7's `mv`, whose structure is the whole design: try `rename`, and on
`EXDEV` copy and remove instead. What is new here is how wide `EXDEV` had to
become.

**There was no rename anywhere in the stack.** Not in `Sys::`, not in `Fs`, not
in `web/fs.js`'s `OP` table — which is why there was no `mv` either. So the
choice was between doing it all in userland and adding the operation. Userland
alone would have worked: `open`, `read_chunk`, `write_all`, `remove_path` are
all there. It would also have made every rename a rewrite — two syscalls per 512
bytes, so `mv sh.wasm sh.old` is 850 round trips — and, worse, it would have
lost the modification time on every move, because §5.2 has a `touch` that sets
the stamp to *now* and no setter at all. Renaming a file is not editing it, and
a system where it looks edited afterwards is lying about its own files.

**But the operation cannot replace the copy, only get in front of it.** OPFS's
`FileSystemHandle.move()` is implemented for a **file** handle alone, and not in
every engine. A directory move is therefore always the copy path today, on every
browser, and so is any move on an engine without the method. That is why
`Sys::Rename`'s `Err(Unsupported)` is specified as an *instruction* rather than
a failure — "not here, copy instead" — and why `/bin/mv` falls back on that one
error and reports every other. It is `EXDEV` with a wider definition of
"different device": a different mount, a directory, an engine that will not.

`web/fs.js` feature-tests the method rather than naming browsers, so an engine
that gains a directory `move()` starts using it with nothing else changed.

**Policy in the kernel, mechanism in the store.** `vfs_rename` decides what may
replace what — kinds must agree, two directories are `Err(Exists)` rather than a
merge, a mount point is refused, a read-only mount at either end is refused —
and every one of those is answered before the round trip. The store and the two
fakes do nothing but "remove the destination, move the handle". That split is
what keeps the fakes honest: they cannot disagree with OPFS about semantics
because they hold none.

They do have to agree about *capability*, though, and that is deliberate.
`test/fakefs.mjs` answers `UNSUPPORTED` for a directory exactly as OPFS does,
and `TempFs` in the unit suite does the same. A fake that could move a directory
would have hidden the copy path from every test — the path that, in a real
browser, is the only one a directory ever takes. This is the same lesson the
symbolic-link work wrote down about `Err(NotDir)`: a fake that is easier than
the thing it stands for is a fake that tests nothing.

**`mv a a` is where the data loss was.** The fallback removes the destination
before it copies, because a rename replaces. If the two paths name one file,
that removal eats the file about to be moved and the copy then has nothing to
read. `vfs_rename` answers `Ok` having done nothing when the two *resolved
physical* paths are equal — which is `rename(2)`'s answer — and `/bin/mv`
repeats the check on its own two absolute paths, because it is the half that
holds the removal. Resolved and physical, so `mv a ./a` and a move through a
link are the same no-op.

**Two orderings in `vfs_rename` are load-bearing.** A mount point is refused
*before* the cross-mount answer: `/home` cannot be moved by copying either, so
`Unsupported` would send the caller off to copy a whole store and then fail to
remove it. And the kind checks come before it too, so `mv file existingdir`
is `Err(IsDir)` rather than a copy that lands somewhere surprising.

**A source with an open descriptor is `Err(Perm)`.** `OpenShared` is keyed on
the path, so a rename underneath one leaves a record naming a file that is no
longer there — and OPFS holds an open file exclusively anyway, so the move would
have failed in the store with a worse error. Refusing is the honest answer, and
the copy fallback would fail on the same lock.

**What the fallback costs, kept rather than papered over.** It restamps, for the
reason above. It is not atomic: the destination is removed before the copy, so
an interrupted directory move leaves a partial tree and no original destination.
Both are visible from the shell — a moved file keeps its `ls -l` stamp and a
moved directory does not — and the smoke test asserts exactly that, which is how
the two paths are told apart without a probe for which one ran.

**The directory walk is an explicit stack, not recursion.** `ls -R`'s shape, and
for `ls -R`'s reason twice over: a coroutine frame per level would make a deep
tree a deep chain of frames, and descending on `SYS_KIND_DIR` alone means a link
is recreated rather than followed, so no cycle guard is needed. A link moves as
itself throughout — `vfs_rename` follows neither end, as `vfs_remove` follows
neither.

**`-f` and `-i` are v7's, and `-f` still wins.** There are no permissions here
and nothing to override, so `-f`'s only remaining job is the one v7 gives it
regardless of order: it silences `-i`. The prompt goes to stderr and the answer
comes through the `Input`/`LineReader` already in `proc/io.h`, so `mv -i` reads
one line per source whether that is a cooked console line or a script's stdin.

`PROC_ABI` moved from 13 to 14, taking op 29 beside the two link operations.

## Symbolic links

A third node kind, and the first change to the filesystem's type system since
it had one. The motive is `/bin/pkg`: a package manager installs
`/bin/vi -> /share/pkg/vim/bin/vim`, and without links the only alternatives are
copying a binary per name or teaching the shell a second lookup rule.

**The whole design is where resolution lives.** Braam's VFS was purely lexical:
`path_resolve` normalised a string, `vfs_lookup` picked a mount by longest
prefix, and the *whole* remaining path went to one backend, which walked it
itself. Nothing had ever looked at a path one component at a time. A textbook
`namei` would be one host round trip per component on every path operation, in a
system that documents a keystroke's two round trips as a floor worth defending.

So resolution is lazy, and rests on a fact about the store rather than on
bookkeeping: **a link in the middle of a path announces itself as
`Err(NotDir)`.** OPFS walks with `getDirectoryHandle`, which raises
`TypeMismatchError` on a file, and a link *is* a file. So `vfs_resolve` hands
the whole path to the backend exactly as before; a success with a non-link leaf
is the answer, and only `Err(NotDir)` — the one failure a link in the middle can
produce — is worth walking. A path with no links in it costs the round trip it
always did, a leaf that really is a link costs one more, and a plain
`Err(NotFound)` costs nothing extra, because it proves every component above the
leaf was a directory.

That fact had to be *made* true in the two fakes. `test/fakefs.mjs` and the unit
suite's `TempFs` are flat maps keyed by whole path; both would have answered
`NotFound` where OPFS answers `NotDir`, and the walk would never have run under
test. Each grew the same six-line ancestor check. A fake that is easier than the
thing it stands for is a fake that tests nothing.

**A listing never resolves.** `Sys::List` reports `SYS_KIND_LINK` whatever the
link points at. That was chosen for tree walks rather than for fidelity: `ls -R`
and the shell's globber both descend on `SYS_KIND_DIR` alone, so neither can
follow a link out of the tree it is walking, and both stayed correct with no
cycle guard added to either. The `-R` entry above used to justify its unbounded
stack by saying the VFS had no links; it now justifies it by saying a link is
not a directory. Only the globber changed, and only for a trailing-slash
pattern, where a link to a directory *should* match — so it stats the links in a
listing and nothing else.

**`..` stays lexical**, which is `cd -L` and what shells do by default.
Resolving it physically would mean `path_resolve` could no longer pop a
component textually, and that function is not only shared with every process
binary but is what `proc_path` relies on being *synchronous*: the dispatcher
makes a process's path absolute against that process's cwd before its first
await, because another task of the same process may move the cwd underneath it.
Making it a `Task` reopens that race to buy a `..` almost nobody types after a
link. The cwd is stored logically for the same reason, so `cd` through a link
and `pwd` says the link.

**A store has nowhere to put a type**, so a link is a file whose whole contents
are `!<braamlink>` and the target — the reasoning, and the rejected sidecar, are
in Concept.md §5.2. Two things fell out of that rather than being written:
`removeEntry` sees a file, so `rm` and `rm -r` cannot follow a link and needed
no code to stop them; and the magic-plus-target form made the fake and the real
store share one classifier instead of holding two ideas of the format.

**One latent bug surfaced.** The open-file table was keyed on the lexical path.
That is fine when a path names one file, and wrong the moment two do: opening
`/bin/vi` and `/share/pkg/vim/bin/vim` would have asked OPFS for two sync access
handles on one file, and OPFS takes an exclusive lock. It is keyed on the
resolved path now, which is the same rule §5.2 already stated from the other
direction — one backend handle per file — and it is what the unit case about a
reader refusing a writer *through the other name* is guarding.

**What this is not.** There are no hard links: OPFS keeps no link count and one
file has one name, so `ln` without `-s` says so rather than pretending. There is
no `readlink` program — `ls -l` prints the target and `Sys::ReadLink` has its
caller there — and no `-L` on `ls`. And `tools/pack.py` does not carry a link
into `rootfs.zip`: nothing in `rootfs/` is one, so the code would be written
against a case that does not exist and tested against none. `/bin/pkg` writing
links into the store at install time is the case that will ask for it.

**Cost.** `PROC_ABI` 12 → 13, invalidating every stamped binary. Ops 27 and 28
were free — the sparse numbering finally paid for itself, and nothing had to
move. `kernel.wasm` went from 154,751 to 167,373 bytes against its 256 KiB
budget, and the boot tree from ~710 KiB to 754,623 against 1 MiB, of which
`/bin/ln` is 13,595.

---

## A package policy, written before the package manager

`/bin/pkg` will be the first thing in the system that fetches bytes from
somewhere else and writes them into the store. `curl` fetches and prints; the
boot unpack writes, but only what the origin served. Nothing in the tree has
ever had to decide whether to believe a stranger.

**The policy went first because the expensive decisions are the ones that cannot
be taken back.** A key generated on a networked machine is never afterwards an
offline key, and a repository trusted once without a signature cannot be
un-trusted retroactively. Writing `pkg` first and adding signatures afterwards
would have meant a key ceremony performed under pressure, which is the same as
no ceremony. [Package_Management.md](Package_Management.md) is the result.

**Two roles, not TUF's four.** TUF's *snapshot* role stops a mix of metadata
files that never coexisted and its *timestamp* role bounds replay without
forcing the larger, rarely re-signed files to expire quickly. Both answer
problems a busy multi-writer repository has. There is one index here, published
whole by one writer, and it carries its own version and its own expiry — so both
properties come from the index itself and a second role would sign a restatement
of it. What that costs is written down rather than hidden: there is no
arrangement in which an attacker must steal two independently held online keys,
and one expiry now sets both the re-signing interval and the replay window. PEP
480's per-author keys arrive as a delegation from the index role, which is a
change to what the index carries and not a new trust anchor — that is the
property that makes the reduction reversible, and it is why it was acceptable.

**The verifier is allowed to be the host's, and that is not a concession.**
The first instinct was SHA-256 and Ed25519 in freestanding C++, linked into
`pkg.wasm`: self-contained, no ABI change, no browser variance, and about 15 KiB
against the archive's budget rather than the kernel's. It was rejected on the
observation that **the host is already inside the trusted base without
qualification.** `web/` hands the kernel every byte of `kernel.wasm`, every byte
of `rootfs.zip` and every process image, and only JS can call a process's
exports (§4.3). A host willing to lie about `crypto.subtle.verify` has the
shorter path of supplying a different `pkg.wasm` — so a wasm verifier would be
guarding a door in a wall that is not there, at the price of two cryptographic
implementations in the tree to keep correct. `crypto.subtle` returns promises,
so it is §2.2's convention already: enum values on each side of `host_svc`, and
the six-import surface `test/run.mjs` asserts does not move.

**A missing algorithm refuses rather than degrades.** WebCrypto's Ed25519
arrived much later in Chrome than in Safari or Firefox, so the availability
question is real. The answer is §5.3's: a capability that is absent is reported,
not worked around. A `pkg` that installs without checking is not a weaker `pkg`;
it is `curl` with extra steps, and the system has `curl`. For the same reason
there is no `--force`, `--insecure` or `--no-verify` in any form — a flag that
skips the check is the flag an attacker's instructions tell the user to pass.

**The anchor lives in `rootfs.zip`, which turns an accident into the recovery
path.** Every signature chain terminates in something believed without proof,
and PEP 458's answer is that the package manager ships the root metadata. Here
the archive is already that: built from the tree, packed by `tools/pack.py`,
served from the origin over the same TLS as `kernel.wasm`. Putting the anchor in
`/share/pkg/` means the boot unpack — which deletes each top-level directory the
archive carries before rewriting it — **re-pins it at every version change**, so
it cannot be poisoned in the store for good. §5.2's "the archive, not the store,
is what the system recovers from" turned out to cover the trust anchor too, and
it is what makes the worst case survivable: replacing an anchor out of band
means cutting a release, and releases already exist. The same behaviour is why a
*locally* trusted key under `/share` is wiped, which is recorded as a cost.

**Packages are not signed; the index is.** apk v2 signs each `.apk`
individually. TUF names targets by hash from signed metadata. The second was
chosen for revocation: withdrawing a package costs a re-signed index and no key
operation at all, whereas a per-package signature has to be reasoned about for
as long as a copy of the file exists anywhere. Signing the set rather than each
entry is what makes "these versions, together" the thing attested — otherwise an
attacker can pair a real signature for a new package with a real signature for
an old one, in a combination the publisher never produced.

**A rejected third option was apk's trusted-key directory** — a folder of public
keys, trust meaning presence in it. It is much less work and it was turned down
for what it lacks rather than what it has: no version and no expiry anywhere,
so neither rollback nor freeze is detectable, and an attacker who can answer for
the network can serve last year's index for ever.

**What the document deliberately does not claim.** `/bin` is writable, OPFS
stores no per-file mode, and `rm /bin/sh` already works, so the property on
offer is "`pkg` installs only what it checked" and not "only checked code runs".
The
second needs a privilege boundary the system does not have, and a policy that
implied it would be worse than one that admits it. The other admissions are in
that document's last section: nothing re-checks the store after install, a
version change erases what `pkg` put in `/bin`, the wall clock is the user's,
and a repository that does not send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is unreachable
rather than insecure.

Nothing is built. Concept.md §6 gains the service as **unbuilt**, and the next
commit is `pkg`'s design — which should need no decision this policy declined to
make.

## Files have a modification time

The filesystem stored `{kind, size}` and nothing else. The section on `ls`,
below, blamed five of BSD's flags on that and was right to — but the store had
been keeping the missing field all along. `getFile()` yields a `File`, a `File`
carries `lastModified`, and `OpfsStore.stat` and `OpfsStore.list` were already
awaiting one apiece to learn a size. The mtime cost one property read.

**Milliseconds, not seconds.** Seconds is Unix's unit, good to 2106, and would
have fitted the free `aux` word in `HostRequest` — no reply shape would have
moved and no buffer would have been reserved per stat. It was rejected on the
one workload this field exists for. A build step in this system finishes in well
under a second, so second-granularity stamps would routinely give a target and
the source it was made from the same time, and a `make` that cannot tell those
apart is not a `make`. The unit that costs something is the unit that works.

**`FsOp::Stat` answers through the buffer now, as `Info` always has.** Its two
scalar channels were both spoken for — `flags` held the kind, `result` held the
64-bit size — and a second u64 does not fit beside them. Borrowing `aux` would
have worked for seconds and not for milliseconds, and adding a word to
`HostRequest` would grow every request record in the system for one operation.
So `Stat` packs `{kind, size, mtime}` into 20 bytes the way `Info` packs 32.
The width is fixed, so `OpfsFs::stat` reserves exactly it and `List`'s
ask-again round trip cannot arise here. The cost is one small allocation per
stat, against a `FsCall` that already allocates the path.

**0 means the filesystem does not know, and `ls -l` prints a dash.** OPFS has no
timestamp on a directory handle at all, and a `/proc` file is generated at
`open` and has no moment to name. Unix would report 0 as a real time and render
`Jan 01  1970`; that reads as a broken clock on every directory in every
listing, which is the same misreading that moved the release archive's stamps
off 1980. A dash says what is true. Nothing here predates 1970, so the sentinel
can never collide with a stamp.

**`touch` moves an mtime by rewriting the file, and checks that it worked.**
OPFS has no setter — there is no `utimes` to reach for and no prospect of one —
so the only lever is to modify the file and let the browser restamp it: its own
first byte written back, or, for an empty file, a byte written and truncated
away. Whether that restamps is the browser's decision and not ours, so the host
reads `lastModified` back and answers `Unsupported` when it has not moved. A
`touch` that silently did nothing would be exactly the failure this system
refuses elsewhere — a thing that looks like it worked. This is also the one
place in the tree where the store's own behaviour, rather than ours, decides
whether an operation exists, and the fake backend cannot answer the question:
`make serve` in a real browser is the only test of it.

`PROC_ABI` went 11 to 12. `Sys::Stat` and `Sys::List` widened, and `Touch` took
op 24, pushing `Chdir` and `Dup` up one — a renumbering worth doing while the
ABI word was moving anyway, since it keeps the path operations contiguous.

**`civil()` moved out of `date` into `src/proc/time.h`.** It was already the
branch-free `civil_from_days`, and already correct; it was in an anonymous
namespace where `ls` could not reach it. `src/proc/` is where it belongs — pure,
no host import, so it is linkable into `tests.wasm` (which is what
`test_time.cpp` does, over the leap-day cases and the two century years the era
arithmetic exists to get right) and it ships with the SDK unasked. `date`'s
output did not move, which is what the unchanged `date -u` assertion checks.

**`ls -l` gains twelve columns and one syscall.** The two BSD forms —
`Mmm DD HH:MM` inside six months, `Mmm DD  YYYY` outside — rather than ISO,
because `date` already renders in that register and a listing that agrees with
the system's own clock command is worth more than lexical sortability nothing
here sorts on. The one `clock_now()` is read only under `-l`, and supplies both
halves of the decision: the timezone to render in, and the "now" the six months
are measured from. A clock that will not answer costs the recent form and not
the listing.

**`-t` is the flag the gap actually cost**, and it arrives with `-S` folded into
one `order` key rather than beside it as a second flag, so the last of the two
given wins the way the last of `-l`, `-1` and `-C` already does. `-i`, `-s`,
`-o`, `-T` and `-L` remain out of reach, and for the original reason: mode,
owner, link count and inode are still not stored anywhere.

**`test -nt` and `-ot` are the first binary file primaries.** `cond.cpp` had
string and integer comparison and no binary operator that looked at a file, so
this adds a shape rather than a row: `CondProbe` grew an `arg2` and the probe
walk answers both files in one go. Both are false when either file is missing,
which is also what two files with no mtime between them answer — a directory
compares false against everything, including another directory.

The fake store stamps from a clock of its own, seeded behind `fakesvc`'s frozen
wall clock so a stamped file reads as the recent past and the `-l` output is
exact. It advances a second per write, which is what gives `ls -t` something to
sort and lets the suite prove `touch` moved a stamp rather than merely returning
success.

`kernel.wasm` grew 2,581 bytes to 154,751 (59% of budget) and the staging tree
5,174 to 736,180 (70%). `ls` is 2,653 of that, `test` 824, `sh` 870, `touch`
677 and `date` 90 — the calendar is shared now, but every binary that links it
still carries its own copy, which is §4.4 again.

## `import` and `save` became `fimport` and `fexport`

The pair was asymmetric because one half of it was never chosen: the shell
builtin owns `export`, so the program that is §5.4's Blob download took the name
that was left ("`/bin/export` became `save`" below). A user who found `import`
had nothing to guess from.

**The `f` is `fopen`'s.** The prefix marks the variant whose plain name is
occupied — `fopen`/`open`, `fstat`/`stat` — and that is exactly the situation
here. It buys guessability in both directions: either half now implies the
other, which neither `import`/`save` nor a one-sided rename would give. The
cost, stated plainly: `fimport` has no occupied sibling to be distinguished
*from*, so its prefix is there for the symmetry rather than for a collision of
its own.

`upload`/`download` was the other candidate and was rejected on register.
Upload and download name a *network* boundary, and this system has one of those
with a program already on it — `curl`. What these two cross is an application
boundary, which is import/export's register. There is also nothing to upload
*to*: the browser calls the picker an upload only because a form posts
somewhere, and here it does not.

**`/import` did not follow.** The directory keeps its name, so `fimport` writes
somewhere not named after it — the one thing given up. Boot creates `/import`
on every run and "/mnt/import became /import" below records that such a rename
migrates nothing; a second orphan directory would leave every existing store's
files stranded in the old one. Weighed against a lost correspondence in a name,
the files win.

**The service was renamed to the bottom, enum spellings included.** `Sys::Save`
is now `Sys::Fexport` (operation 56 — the *number* did not move, so nothing on
the wire changed), `SvcOp::Save` is `SvcOp::Fexport`, `save_file` is
`fexport_file`, the SDK's `save()` is `fexport()`, and the page verb `svc:
"save"` is `svc: "fexport"`. The alternative was renaming the program alone and
leaving a `save` stack under it, which reads as an unfinished rename to whoever
finds it next.

The argument against going this deep, recorded because the decision went the
other way: the `f` prefix exists to dodge a *shell builtin*, and there are no
builtins below the shell, so these layers now carry a marker that means nothing
where they live — an ABI operation named after a workaround from above it. What
carried the day is that a half-renamed stack costs every future reader a
question, while a uniformly-named one costs only this paragraph.

**It is a shipped SDK break.** `save()` is declared in the installed
`include/braam/proc/io.h`, so an out-of-tree program calling it stops compiling
and must say `fexport()`. There is no deprecation shim: the SDK has no
compatibility surface yet and starting one for a two-command system would
outlive its usefulness.

Nothing needed a new test. The M6 criterion already drives both programs
end to end, and it now drives them under their new names; the per-binary ABI
assertions read a glob rather than a list, so they followed the rename without
being touched. One thing the rename *did* surface: `build/web/` is assembled by
`copy_directory`, which never deletes, so the first build after it carried 41
binaries — the two old ones included. `make clean` is the answer and the
CMake section of CLAUDE.md already says so.

## `export notes.txt` is refused rather than obeyed

It surfaced out of a naming question — whether `/bin/import` and `/bin/save`
should become `upload`/`download`, or `fimport`/`fexport` — and the answer
turned out not to be a rename at all.

`/bin/import` has no `/bin/export` because the builtin owns that name
("`/bin/export` became `save`" below). So a user who has found `import` and
wants the way back out guesses `export`, and until now the guess *worked*: the
builtin handed its operand straight to `var_mark`, which validates nothing, and
the shell created an exported variable named `notes.txt`, printed nothing and
exited 0. Of the ways that line could have failed, silent success is the worst
one — nothing to search for, nothing in `$?`, and a variable in every child's
environment from then on. `read notes.txt` did the same.

**No rename closes that**, which is the argument for leaving `import` and `save`
alone. A user under `fimport`/`fexport` still guesses `export` the first time;
what they need is for the guess to say no. The asymmetry between `import` and
`save` is a scar with a reason, and it cost exactly one thing, which is now
paid.

**Checked before the value**, so `export 2a=1` neither assigns nor marks. The
alternative — assign, then refuse the mark — would leave a variable behind from
a line that reported failure. The remaining operands are still applied and the
refusals are collected into one write, which is what the readonly refusal
beside it already did.

**`read` validates every name before it reads**, not as it fills them. A usage
error that consumed a line would be a silent data loss inside `while read`, and
the loop would then end on the next iteration for the wrong reason.

**`var_init` is deliberately exempt.** It imports the environment blob the
kernel handed the process, and dropping an entry there would be a silent loss
of something a caller meant to pass — the failure this change exists to remove.
An environment is not a place to enforce the shell's spelling rules.

**The rule was written three times**, all file-local: `is_name` in `parse.cpp`,
a hand-inlined copy of the same character class inside `is_assignment` beside
it, and `is_name_start`/`is_name_char` in `expand.cpp`. None was visible outside
its own translation unit, so a builtin could not ask the question the grammar
had already answered — which is how the hole survived this long. They are now
one header-only `name.h`, included by both grammar files and by the two
builtins. Header-only and `inline` matters: `braam_sh`'s builtins reach a
syscall and the grammar is compiled into `tests.wasm`, which links no process
runtime, so a shared `.cpp` would have had to be pure anyway and a shared
header costs nothing either way.

The predicate is unit-tested; the builtins cannot be, since `write_all` is a
syscall and the unit suite links none, so their behaviour is asserted in
`run.mjs` — including that the refused name reaches no child's environment and
that a refused `read` leaves the line for the next one.

## Pids are reused, and syscall servers no longer spend them

This reverses "The pid counter saturates rather than wraps" below. The reasoning
there was sound on its own terms and the terms have changed: the requirement is
now that the system run for as long as the tab is open, and a counter that only
climbs is a lifetime rather than a bound. Two things came out of taking that
seriously.

**The wall was closer than the counter.** `next_pid` is a `u32`, but
`SYS_PID_MAX` was `0xffffff` and `Sys::Spawn` refused any pid above it, so the
system stopped being able to run programs at 16.7M spawns — not 4.3 billion.
That is about two minutes of bulk piping at 150k parked syscalls a second.
`/proc/stat`'s `spawns` was already measuring it; nobody had divided.

**The fire hose was not processes.** 99.99% of the space went to the syscall
server each parked call gets, which is a task `Wait`, `Kill` and `Fg` cannot
name — the op word carries a pid, but all three look it up in the caller's own
children, so a number that names no child of yours is `Err(Perm)` whatever it
is. Spending a nameable resource on unnameable things was the actual defect.
Servers now come from a second table with ids above `SYS_PID_MAX`, and the pid
space is spent only on what can be addressed: at a heroic ten programs a second
it lasts nineteen days, and at a realistic rate, years.

**Two tables rather than one partitioned vector.** A range test on the id would
have served the allocator, and a single `jobs` vector would have kept one sweep,
one teardown order and one gauge loop. Two tables cost a second pass in each of
those and a teardown-ordering argument that used to come free — `anon` is
destroyed first, because a server is spawned after the process it serves and its
frame holds a `ProcRef` and awaitables parked on that process's stdio. What they
buy is that `sched_procs` walks one table and is done: an anonymous job is not
in `/proc` because it is not in the structure `/proc` reads, rather than because
every reader remembers to filter.

**Servers left `/proc`, and that is a real loss.** You can no longer see *which*
syscall a wedged process is stuck in — only how many, from `/proc/<pid>`'s
`calls`. Against it: `ps` during a large pipe was mostly rows for one-syscall
coroutines, and the PID column had grown to six and seven digits reporting how
much I/O the session had done rather than how many commands had been run.
`PROC_MAX` is 64, and a bulk pipeline could push the snapshot past it and
truncate `/proc/tasks` silently; processes alone will not. `exec_proc_state`'s
nested scan over every process × every outstanding call — which existed only to
give a server row a `ppid` — is deleted.

**The gauges still count what the listing hides.** `/proc/stat`'s `tasks`,
`ready`, `on_timer`, `on_host` and `on_park` cover both tables, so `tasks` is
now larger than the number of `/proc/tasks` rows. Hiding a job from a listing is
not hiding it from a count, and `on_host` counting the servers is the half of
that figure worth reading — `vmstat` relies on it, since its own server is
runnable while its stepper is parked.

**Reuse is made safe by reservation, not by the wrap being large.** The old note
is right that skipping *live* pids cannot help, because every dangerous case is
a pid held across the death of the task it named. So those cases hold the pid
explicitly: `sched_pid_hold` is a counted set the allocator skips, taken by an
uncollected `Child` entry and by a foreground entry, which the audit found to be
the whole list. The other holders identify their subject some other way and
needed nothing — the keyboard and screen claims compare pointer identity
(`g_raw == ring_`), and `web/proc.js`'s map entry is deleted by `End::~End`
before the job is reaped. `Call::server` was the near miss: `serve` deletes the
`Call` before returning on every path but one, and that one now clears `server`
so the invariant is flat — it names a live job or it is 0. With the holds in
place, the shell's `alive()` over `/proc/<pid>` needs no change, since the file
existing again can only mean the same task.

**`SYS_PID_MAX` is 999999 and not `0xffffff`.** Six digits keeps `ps`'s PID
column at seven characters, which is what the width-from-the-table work below
was compensating for. It is no longer the op word's limit — the argument is 24
bits and would carry 999999 with room to spare — so the constant's meaning
changed from "the largest the field can carry" to "the largest pid there is",
and `test_sysabi` now asserts both separately: `SYS_PID_MAX + 1` round-trips,
and the field truncates at `1 << 24`.

**`PROC_ABI` did not move.** No wire format, operation, payload or import
changed. A binary built against the old constant differs only in that a stale
`ps` would look for rows that no longer exist, which is cosmetic; bumping would
force every out-of-tree SDK program to be rebuilt for nothing structural.

**`wraps` is a new `/proc/stat` counter.** Laps of the pid space, which after
this change is the event worth knowing about — the anonymous space wraps freely
and is not counted, since nothing names one of its ids past its job.

## The pid counter saturates rather than wraps

`sched_spawn` refuses to spawn once `next_pid` has come back round to 0, instead
of handing that 0 out and carrying on.

Nothing reaches this. The counter is a `u32` and only a spawn advances it; a
page would have to run for days doing nothing but parking syscalls. But it moves
faster than it reads: since each parked syscall gets a scheduler job of its own,
the counter advances at *syscall* rate rather than at process rate, and bulk I/O
through a pipeline burns a pid per `SYS_CHUNK` per stage — about 1,500 for a
quarter of a megabyte through three processes. Fast-path calls (`sysfast`) park
nothing and cost none. What used to be "one pid per program you ran" is now a
number with a plausible growth rate behind it, which is reason enough to say
what happens at the end of it.

The wrap would have been silent and would have handed out the one value the
whole system reads as *nobody*: `sched_spawn`'s failure return,
`tty_keys_owner()`'s "unclaimed", `SYS_WAIT_ANY`, `Fg(0)`, `link.pid = 0`. A
`Proc` whose child was pid 0 would wait on a child it could not name.

Two ways to not wrap. Restart the counter at 1 and skip pids still in use, which
is what a system with a small pid space does — but pids are never reused here,
and a good deal depends on that: a process's exit status is recorded on its
parent's record by a destructor that finds the parent by pid, long after the
parent might have been replaced by a namesake. Or stop. Stopping costs one
comparison, needs no free-pid scan, and lands on a path every caller already
handles, since a spawn can already fail for want of memory. The pid space is a
resource like any other and running out of it is an out-of-resources failure,
not a wrap.

Not sixteen bits with reuse, which is the other way to never wrap. Sixteen bits
is about half a second of piped I/O at the rate above, so recycling would be the
steady state rather than an edge, and three places would then be wrong within
seconds of each other: the shell reaps a background job by asking whether
`/proc/<pid>` still exists (`alive` in `job.cpp`) and would find a stranger and
report its job as still running; `console_fg_has(pid)` compares bare pids, so
`^C` would aim at whatever inherited the number; and the destructor that reports
an exit status calls `proc_find(parent)` deliberately *after* the parent may be
gone, relying on that lookup failing. All three are designs in which a failed
lookup means *gone*, and non-reuse is what makes it mean that. Skipping pids
that are currently live does not help — every one of those is a pid held across
the death of the task it named, which is exactly what skipping cannot see.
Nothing stores a pid narrowly (`sysabi.h` is `u32` throughout) so the narrower
space buys no memory either.

`ps` computes the PID and PPID column widths from the table it just read,
instead of the constant
5. The counter now advances per parked syscall, so a session passes 99,999 in
   about half a minute of piped I/O, and `put_right` writes anything wider than
   its column whole — every row after that would shift right and the table would
   stop being one. The width is the widest value **plus one**: the two columns
   are adjacent with nothing but their padding between them, so at exactly full
   width `100070` and `100068` print as `100070100068`. The old constant hid
   that by being one wider than any pid it ever saw.

## WORKER was the CWD column saying it twice

`ps` has ten columns rather than eleven and `/proc/tasks` twelve fields rather
than thirteen: the worker is gone from both. `/proc/<pid>` keeps its `worker`
line.

**The column carried one bit, and four other columns already carried it.**
`exec_proc_state` fills `worker`, `calls`, `fds`, `pages` and `cwd` together or
not at all, because they all come from the `Proc` the pid does or does not have.
A `Proc`'s cwd is never empty — `exec_process` assigns `vfs_cwd()` when the
spawn named none, and a process whose assignment fails never starts — so `CWD`
is `-` exactly when `WORKER` was, and it is the one of the two that also answers
a question worth asking. What is lost is a *label*: `bound` said "this is a
process" in a word, where the reader now infers it. That is the trade, and seven
columns of an eighty-column row is what it buys.

**`dying` went with it, and was unreachable.** `worker_of` had a third value for
`st.dead`, but `End` sets `p->dead` and calls `proc_remove(p)` three lines later
in the same destructor with no await between, so `proc_find` never returns a
record with it set and no reader ever saw the word. `ProcState::dead` is
deleted; `Proc::dead` stays, since `Sys::Wait`'s parent check reads it — where,
for the same reason, the `!par` beside it is what actually fires.

**`ps` used the field as its own predicate** — `worker != "-"` decided whether
CALLS and FDS print a number or a dash — and now tests the cwd instead. That is
the whole of the program's change beyond the column itself, and it is why the
field could not simply be left in the file unread.

**`/proc/<pid>` is the exception on purpose.** A pid with no process behind it
prints no `cwd` line there at all, and no `fds` and no cap: the file is named
lines rather than a fixed row, so absence says nothing and `worker -` is the
only positive statement that this is a kernel coroutine. Concept.md §5.1 now
says the two files differ in that, and why.

`kernel.wasm` 151,028 → 150,828.

## The `braam:` prefix is gone

Everything the system writes to its own screen used to begin `braam:` — the
shell's `say` and `say2`, `exec`'s `<path>: crashed` and `no worker, retrying`,
and every line boot and init print. It says nothing: there is one system on that
screen and it has already named itself in the banner one row above.
`braam: sh: too many processes` is now `sh: too many processes`, and
`braam: the shell died (status 132)` is `the shell died (status 132)`.

**What the prefix was actually drawing** is the line between the runtime
speaking and a builtin speaking, which Shell.md still records: a builtin says
`<name>: <what>: <why>` and names itself, because several of them can fail the
same way and the name is the only thing that says which one did. The runtime is
not one of several. Where its message names a path or a command word, that word
is what the reader needs and now leads the line; where it does not, the sentence
was always the whole message.

**It is kept where the terminal is not the destination.** `panic()` goes through
`host_log` to the browser console, and `web/braam.js`, `web/render.js` and
`web/worker.js` throw or report to the embedding page — text landing among
everything else that page logs, where the prefix is the only thing saying who
spoke. The rule is the destination, not the severity: on the Braam screen
nothing needs telling, off it everything does.

`sh_source` was the one caller that had to change shape rather than lose a
literal: it printed through `errln("braam", path, err)`, whose first argument is
the speaker, and now passes the path as the speaker with an empty middle — the
form `errln` already had for a program naming a file.

`kernel.wasm` 151,542 → 151,028: seven bytes of literal in a dozen places, and
one `write` per diagnostic in `exec`.

Notes below this one quote the old prefix in their examples. They are what was
true when they were written and are left alone.

## Sixteen deep, and saying so

`SYS_PROC_DEPTH` is 16, from 8, and a spawn refused by either bound now prints
`braam: <name>: too many processes` rather than `not executable`.

**Eight was reached by hand.** Typing `sh` at the prompt costs a level, so the
eighth one was refused: init's shell is depth 0 and the check is on the child's
depth, which makes the bound "processes in a chain, counting the first" — seven
nested shells and then a refusal, on a system where a nested shell is the
ordinary way to try something in another directory. The bound exists for the
fork bomb, and a fork bomb does not care whether it is stopped at 8 or at 16:
the depth cap is the second of two, and `SYS_CHILD_MAX` still holds the width at
16, so the product is what bounds the tree either way. Doubling the one that a
person walks into and leaving the one that a bomb walks into is the whole
change.

**What sixteen costs.** Nothing at rest — depth is a `u32` on `Proc`, not a
table — and at worst sixteen live instances in a chain, each a worker of its own
and each about 900 KiB committed of its 16 MB cap. The host makes workers on
demand (`MAX_IDLE` is the pool's size, not a ceiling on live ones), so a deep
chain hires rather than waiting; there is no new way to deadlock. A chain that
deep is a person nesting shells or a script recursing, and the recursion is
exactly what the bound is for.

**The message named the wrong problem.** Both bounds answer `Err(NoMemory)`, and
the shell spelled out only `NotFound` and `Unsupported`, so a depth refusal fell
through to `not executable` — which points at the binary, sends the reader to
`test -x` and to rebuilding, and is false: `/bin/sh` is a program and had just
run seven times. A new `Error` value would say it exactly and is still far too
expensive for a diagnostic string, for the reason the `#!` notes below give:
`Error` crosses the wire as a negated `i32` in every reply, so it means a
`PROC_ABI` bump and `web/` changes. So the shell reads the value that already
arrives. The cost is that a genuine allocation failure inside `Sys::Spawn` now
says `too many processes` too — the wrong half of one error rather than the
wrong error, and the status stays 126, which is still what "found and would not
run" means.

The test is a script that runs itself: `deep.sh` recurses until the kernel
refuses, and every level above the deepest returns its status, so the error is
printed once and 126 comes back to the prompt. It is also a fork bomb with the
bound taken out, which is the point of running it.

System_Calls.md said `SYS_CHILD_MAX` was 8 in prose and 16 in the table beneath;
the prose was stale and is now the table's number.

## `#!` after all

A text file beginning `#!/` or `#! /` is now a program. `./script.sh` runs, a
bare `script` in `/bin` runs, `Sys::Spawn` on one from any process runs, and
`test -x` agrees. `kernel.wasm` went 149,613 → 151,542 of 262,144 and `sh.wasm`
218,887 → 219,637, the staging tree 727,600 → 729,099 of 1 MiB. **`PROC_ABI` is
still 11**: argv is still argv and the host still receives
`(path, image, ProcMeta)`, so nothing a binary observes moved. A diff touching
`sysabi.h` reads like a bump and this one is not.

**This reverses "`#!` is settled rather than deferred" below**, which argued
that "there is no place to put an interpreter lookup that would not be the
kernel reading file contents to decide what a program is". The premise is right
and the conclusion does not follow: the kernel already reads file contents to
decide what a program is — that is the whole of `exec_meta`, which walks the
section list looking for `braam`. Reading eight bytes further into the same
image, in the same function, against the same contract, adds no capability the
kernel did not have. What the old argument was really protecting was that `exec`
should not *guess*, and that survives intact: a text file with no `#!` is still
`Err(Invalid)`, and there is no sniffing of any kind beyond the two literal
prefixes.

**Three bounds are what make it a rule rather than a search.** The interpreter
is **absolute**, because the `/` is required after `#!` — there is no PATH here
and one directory is not a search path, so a relative interpreter has nothing to
resolve against and is refused rather than guessed at. The lookup is **one level
deep**, which is v7's and Linux's ENOEXEC answer: an interpreter that is itself
a script is `Err(Invalid)`. And the first line must end within
`PROC_SHEBANG_MAX`, so a file is decided by its head rather than by a scan. That
cap is 128 and is `static_assert`ed against `SYS_CHUNK`, because `test -x`
decides from a single `read_chunk`: the two answers can only agree while a whole
`#!` line fits in one. Tying them at the constant is what keeps a later raise
from silently splitting `exec` and `-x` apart.

**`exec_resolve` became a two-round loop rather than a recursive call.** A
nested `Task` would be a second coroutine frame and a second allocation on the
path every command takes, and "one level only" written as a loop bound is a fact
the compiler enforces rather than a convention a later edit can drift past.

**`Executable::path` is the interpreter's now, and it had to be.** It is the key
the host caches the compiled `Module` under and it is what the no-worker backoff
re-reads on each retry; keying either on the script would hand the host a text
file. The cost is that `braam: /bin/sh: crashed` names the interpreter rather
than the script — which is truthful, since the interpreter is what crashed.
Nothing a user navigates by moved: `ps`, `jobs`, `/proc` and `kill %n` all read
the scheduler's job name, which `sched_spawn` takes from the caller's word, so
they still say `./script.sh`. A second `String` holding a display name would
have bought three error messages and cost a field on every `Executable`, one of
which lives on init's coroutine frame.

**A missing interpreter is 126, not 127.** Letting the interpreter's
`Err(NotFound)` through would print `braam: ./s.sh: not found` for a script that
plainly exists, and would spend the one status that means "the command word
names nothing" on a file that does name something. So the second round's
`NotFound` alone collapses to `Invalid` — "not executable" — and every other
error is let through unchanged, which keeps the genuinely useful one: a stale
interpreter still reports `Err(Unsupported)` and prints
`built for another process ABI`, naming the repair. A new `Error` value was the
alternative and is far too expensive for a diagnostic string: `Error` crosses
the wire as a negated `i32` in every reply, so it would mean a `PROC_ABI` bump,
`web/` changes and a System_Calls.md edit.

**A script costs one process, not two.** The resolution happens before any
process exists, so `SYS_PROC_DEPTH` and `SYS_CHILD_MAX` count the interpreter
exactly as they counted a binary, and every script shares `/bin/sh`'s
already-compiled `Module` — the second and later scripts pay the instantiation
and the worker, not the compile.

**The cost, stated rather than hidden: a script's image is read twice.**
`exec_resolve` reads the whole file through the ordinary VFS before it can
discover it is not a module, keeps 128 bytes of it and throws the rest away; the
interpreter then reads the same file again. Avoiding it means splitting
`read_file` into a probe-then-rest read, which is a worse VFS for files that are
small by nature. The `#!` rule lives in `sysabi.h` beside `PROC_SECTION` and
`PROC_MAGIC` for the same reason those are there — it is the exec contract — and
being a header is what lets `src/cmd/sh/condrun.cpp` answer `-x` from the one
statement of it, since `braam_sh` cannot reach `src/user/`. Being `inline` costs
nothing: it is expanded into its single call site in each of the three binaries
that call it and emitted out of line in none of them.

## Seconds, and `-m` for the machine's unit

`sleep`, `timeout` and `watch -n` took **milliseconds**, and `vmstat` took
**seconds**. Every duration a user types is now seconds, and all four accept
`-m` to mean the number is milliseconds instead. `sleep 5` waits five seconds,
`sleep -m 5` returns almost at once.

**Why the divergence was there, and why a flag keeps it.** The earlier note
below — "`sleep` takes milliseconds; there is no float parser, the scheduler is
a millisecond machine, and the smoke test needs an exact number to assert
`tick()`'s return value against" — was three arguments, and only the third is
still load-bearing. The float parser is still absent and the argument is still
`parse_u32`, so seconds cost nothing to parse; the scheduler being a millisecond
machine is an implementation fact that `sleep_for(secs * 1000)` hides in one
multiply. But the test harness really does own the clock and really does assert
the exact millisecond `tick()` reports, and a whole second is a clumsy unit for
a virtual clock whose ticks are hand-picked ten milliseconds apart. `-m` is what
preserves that: `test/run.mjs` spells every one of its delays with it, so not a
single tick value or hand-written `now` in that file moved when the default
changed. A seconds-only change would have had to retime four blocks and rewrite
the `[30, 20, -1]` assertion that has stood since M1.

The alternative was a fractional parser — `sleep 0.5` — which reads better than
`sleep -m 500` and was rejected on cost: it is real parsing code in four
binaries that each carry their own copy of `text.cpp`, to express something no
caller in the tree wants. `sleep 0.5` is a usage error, not a rounding.

**This supersedes two paragraphs further down.** vmstat's *"Seconds, which makes
it the one time argument here that is not milliseconds"* now describes the rule
rather than the exception, and its first clause — that a rate per second wants
an interval in seconds — is the argument that won generally. M3's *"`sleep`
takes milliseconds… the divergence from POSIX lives in the usage string"* is
retired; the usage string reads `usage: sleep [-m] <seconds>` and there is no
divergence left to record.

**Nothing below the command line moved.** `Sys::Sleep`'s payload is still
milliseconds (§4.3) and `sleep_for(u32 ms)` is still the SDK's call, so this is
four argument parsers and four usage strings. `vmstat` needed slightly more care
than the others: its columns are rates *per second* whatever `-m` says, and its
"a count without an interval paces itself" default has to stay a whole second
under `-m` too, since a one-millisecond interval would measure nothing but
vmstat.

`watch`'s ad-hoc `args[1] == "-n"` became a leading-option loop in vmstat's
style, so `-m` and `-n` compose in either order. The three ordinary programs cap
a seconds argument at 4,294,967 — as many as convert to milliseconds inside a
`u32` — and refuse anything above it rather than wrapping; under `-m` the
parser's own range is the cap.

**What the tests gained.** `sleep 5` asserting `tick()` returns 5000 is the
whole seconds path in one line, and `watch -n 100` asserting an interval of
100000 is the same check for the one program whose conversion is not at the top
of `proc_main`. The refusals — `sleep 0.5`, `sleep 4294968`, `sleep -m` with no
number, `watch -n 4294968` — are cheap and pin the boundary. Three copies of
`/share/help` are `wc`'d by an unrelated case, so lengthening four help lines
moved a byte count there — the exact number is worth keeping over a looser
assertion precisely because it notices.

## The wheel is a keystroke

Scrollback has been reachable only from the keyboard since it arrived, and the
gesture everyone tries first — a wheel, a two-finger swipe — did nothing at all.
Closing that cost **no import, no export, no message the kernel understands and
no mouse in the ABI**: the page turns a wheel notch into the keystrokes the
chord is already made of.

**Why not a tenth export.** `scroll(lines)` was the obvious shape and would have
been exact: one call, one repaint, no chord to invent. It was rejected because
it puts a pointer gesture into the ABI, which §3.5 spends a paragraph saying it
does not have — the selection, the key bar, the paste and the soft keyboard are
all page-side, and each of them arrives as an ordinary `{code, mods}` or as
nothing at all. The wheel is not a different kind of input; it is a way of
asking for the scroll chord, exactly as the key bar is a way of asking for
`Esc`. So the page sends keys, the kernel cannot tell a wheel-born Shift+Up from
a typed one, and the export list stays at nine.

**The chord grew a row.** Half a screen a notch is unusable, so `console_pump`
now takes Shift+Up and Shift+Down beside Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown, one
row instead of `rows / 2`. Nothing else in the tree binds Shift with an arrow,
so no claimant lost a key it was reading, and the keyboard gains a
line-at-a-time scroll it did not have — the feature is worth having on its own,
which is part of the argument for this shape over an export.

**A claimed screen keeps the fall-through, and `less` gets the wheel free.** The
chord is not the pump's while a program holds the screen, so the synthetic key
is delivered raw like any other — and `less` switches on `k.code` without
looking at the modifier, so a wheel over the pager pages it a line at a time
with nothing written for it. `edit` moves its cursor a row, which is the same
bargain and harmless. Swallowing the key while the screen is claimed was the
alternative: more predictable, and it makes the wheel dead inside the two
programs where scrolling is the whole point.

**Pixels cross, rows are computed in the worker.** `deltaY` is device pixels,
lines or pages depending on the platform and the input device, and only the
worker knows `cellH` — it owns the font, which is why it also owns the geometry
(`fit`). So `web/braam.js` posts the delta in device pixels, as a selection drag
already does, and `web/worker.js` divides. The leftover fraction is **carried
between events**: a trackpad delivers a few pixels at a time, and truncating
each one independently means a slow swipe scrolls nothing ever. The residue is
zeroed when the direction reverses (a reversal continues nothing) and in `fit`,
where the row height it is a fraction of changes underneath it. A page-mode
delta is passed to the half-screen chord instead of being converted, since that
is what it already means.

**Fed like a paste.** The run goes through `key()` and stops when it returns
false, which is the back-pressure the ring's return value exists for (§3.5), and
it is clamped to a ring's worth so a fling cannot outrun it. One `pump()` for
the whole run, so *n* rows cost one composition pass and one `host_present`
rather than *n* of each. It deliberately does not touch `key_at` or the sample
array: those measure what a *keystroke* costs, and a wheel event is not one.

**`Ctrl`+wheel is the browser's.** A trackpad pinch arrives as a wheel with
`ctrlKey` set, and zoom belongs to the user. Everything else over the canvas is
prevented and taken, which is the same claim `touch-action: none` already makes
for a drag — an embedding page does not scroll under a terminal the pointer is
over. Touch is still not covered: a one-finger drag selects, and a two-finger
scroll gesture would need a decision about which one wins.

## The environment crosses a spawn

`export` set a bit nothing read. §4.5 listed it as one of six things v7 has that
this cannot, and the reason given was true: `Sys::Spawn` carried three
descriptors, an argv and a cwd, and there was nowhere to put a variable. Closing
that gap cost `PROC_ABI` 10 → 11 and **no new operation, no new import or
export, and not one line of `web/proc.js`.**

**One encoding, two blobs, no length word.** An environment is a word list in
exactly the format `argv_encode` already wrote, its words `NAME=value`, so there
is one codec rather than two and `env` needs no parser of its own. The two blobs
sit back to back — in `_start`'s payload and after `Sys::Spawn`'s three
descriptor words — and the join is found by walking the first (`argv_bytes`)
rather than by a length word in front. A length word was the obvious alternative
and is worse: it would sit where `argc` sits, so `argv_count(payload, len)` and
the existing assertion in `test_sysabi.cpp` would both have had to learn about
it. Walking is free where it matters, because both readers already walk the argv
blob to the end. `argv_bytes` reports 0 for anything it cannot walk, and that is
unambiguous: the smallest well-formed blob is the four bytes of an empty word
list, so "malformed" and "empty" are told apart and the kernel refuses rather
than entering a child with rubbish.

**The kernel holds it, beside the cwd, and inheritance is the default.** The
alternative was to hold nothing and have `spawn()` re-serialise the caller's
environment on every call, which keeps the kernel stateless and puts the truth
on the wire every time. It was rejected for what it does to a program that
starts a program: `timeout 5 env` and `watch ls` would each have had to ask for
their own environment and hand it on, and one that forgot would silently strip
it. So `Proc` gains a `String env`, `Sys::Spawn`'s op-word argument — unused
until now — gains bit 0 meaning "an env blob follows", and a spawn that says
nothing hands the child the caller's. The common case puts zero bytes on the
wire. `SYS_ENV_MAX` bounds it, because a child hands its own on and an unbounded
one would grow down a chain of them.

**There is no `setenv`, and a `Sys::Env` would have failed §4.3's own rule.**
Every operation has a caller in `src/cmd/`, and this one would have had none:
the shell keeps its variable table in its own memory and builds the blob afresh
at each spawn, so it never needs to ask the kernel to change anything. A
process's environment is therefore fixed at spawn — stronger than v7, which is a
fair trade for an operation nothing wanted. It also keeps the synchronous half
of the ABI closed: `getenv` would have had to be asynchronous, since the sync
half is answered inside the worker with no kernel to ask, and a `co_await` to
read a variable is a bad shape.

**The runtime walks the environment rather than indexing it, and `hog` is why.**
The first version built a `Vec<Str>` in `_start` beside the argv one. That is
one heap block in every process that will never use it, and it broke `hog` —
which allocates until the heap refuses, hands one 64 KiB span back, and reports.
The failure was not the sixteen bytes: it was the size *class*. `_alloc(4)` for
the reply the kernel writes back used to land in the span the argv block had
already seeded, and a bigger `_start` block moved that block to another class,
leaving no span able to serve four bytes. Walking on demand removes the
allocation, which is the right answer anyway — `Rt` holds a pointer and a
length, `proc_env` is a linear scan over a handful of words, and a program that
never asks pays nothing. `hog` now hands back two spans instead of one, and says
so: reporting needs coroutine frames *and* a reply block, and those are
different size classes once nothing else is left. That fragility was always
there; the environment is only what exposed it.

**`x=1 prog` finally goes somewhere.** The note under M9 explains why an
assignment prefix on a program stage used to be expanded and then dropped —
applying it to the shell would have leaked it, and there was nowhere else. Now
it goes into that child's environment and nowhere else, which is v7's semantics
exactly. A prefix *replaces* an exported variable of the same name in the words
handed over rather than arriving beside it, because a lookup takes the first
match and a second word would never be reached. Prefixes on builtin and function
stages keep the apply-and-restore they had: those run in the shell's own turn
and have no spawn to ride.

**A nested shell reads its environment back into its table.** `var_init` seeds
from `proc_env_at`, marking each entry exported, so
`export a=1; sh -c 'echo $a'` works and the environment is not swallowed by the
one program most likely to be in the middle of a chain. Without it the feature
would have reached every program *except* another `/bin/sh`.

**Init gives the shell `HOME` and `SHELL` and nothing else.** `PATH` is absent
because there is no search path to describe — a command word resolves as
function, then builtin, then `/bin` — and a `PATH` that did not steer resolution
would be a lie a script could believe. `TERM` is absent because §2.3's terminal
is a cell grid with no escape sequences and no terminfo entry that could
describe it; `Sys::Tty` is how a program asks about the terminal, and a
`COLUMNS` would be a copy taken at spawn that the first resize made wrong. `cd`
with no argument now reads `$HOME`, falling back to the literal `/home`, which
is what makes the one variable init plants mean something rather than being
decoration.

**`/bin/env` is a program, not a builtin.** Neither clause of §4's rule fits it:
it does not touch the shell's own state, and its whole cost is not the spawn —
it *makes* a spawn, which is the thing a builtin cannot do. It is the worked
example for both halves of the new `spawn` signature, and it is what makes the
feature testable end to end from `run.mjs`.

## src/sh became src/cmd/sh

The shell is a program (§4), and it was the only program whose code did not live
in `src/cmd/`. `src/sh/` was a top-level tree beside `src/fs/`, `src/svc/` and
`src/user/` — the layers *below* userland — and being there said the shell was
one of those, which stopped being true when it became a binary. It is
`src/cmd/sh/` now, a directory beside the thirty-four one-file programs, and its
entry point is `main.cpp` inside it rather than `src/cmd/sh.cpp` outside.
Nothing else in the tree gains a directory by doing this: a program that needs
one is what the shell is, and `braam_add_program` already takes a source path
rather than assuming `<name>.cpp`.

**The build got shorter, not longer.** `add_subdirectory(src/sh)` left the
top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and became `add_subdirectory(sh)` at the top of
`src/cmd/`'s own, so the shell's library is declared where its binary is.
`/bin/test` names `sh/cond.cpp sh/condrun.cpp` instead of `../sh/cond.cpp` — the
same two files, no longer reached for through a parent.

**`#include "sh/x.h"` became `#include "cmd/sh/x.h"`**, which is the only cost.
Includes are root-relative from `src/`, so the builtins and `src/cmd/test.cpp`
and the five unit tests that reach into the shell all name a directory deeper
than before. Sibling includes inside the shell are unchanged, because a quoted
include finds a sibling first — which is why `main.cpp` says `"shell.h"` where
`src/cmd/sh.cpp` had said `"sh/shell.h"`.

`sh.wasm` is 215,270 bytes before and after, to the byte, and the three CTest
cases pass unchanged. Notes above this one name the old paths where they are
describing what happened at the time; their file *links* were repointed, so none
is dead.

## The shell's plan is deleted, and what only it held is here

Last of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`, and the one that deletes it. Ten stages
had landed and each has a note of its own below, so what the plan still held was
a to-do list with nothing to do plus four things written nowhere else: **the
grammar and the expansion order**, **the six impossibilities**, **the purity
boundary**, and **the size trajectory**. The first two are now Concept.md §4.5,
which the specification had been missing entirely; the last two are here. **No
behaviour changed**: `sh.wasm` went 215,238 → 215,270, and all thirty-two of
those bytes are one usage string — `unset` had taken `-f` since the functions
stage and its one-line help had never said so. The staging tree is 704,061 of
1,048,576 (67%), 277 KiB as `rootfs.zip`; `kernel.wasm` is 148,604 of 262,144,
byte for byte what S7 left; `PROC_ABI` is still 10.

**Cite the stages by name, not by ordinal.** The ten notes below number
themselves *first* to *tenth*, and those ordinals are **one ahead of the plan's
S-numbers** from the beginning: *"The lexer stopped removing quotes"* took a
note without taking a stage number, so the plan's S1 is the second note, its S7
is *"The ABI changed, once"* and its S9 is *"The shell got a front door"*. The
S-numbers are kept as citations the way the worker plan's T-numbers were —
CLAUDE.md and the commit messages say "S7" and mean the `Sys::Dup` stage — but a
heading is the unambiguous name and this note is the last place the two schemes
have to be reconciled.

**The purity boundary is a standing rule, not a stage's tactic.** `parse.cpp`,
`tokenize.cpp`, `expand.cpp`, `match.cpp` and `cond.cpp` touch nothing but
`Str`, `String` and `Vec`, and `test/CMakeLists.txt` compiling them into
`tests.wasm` **is** the enforcement: a syscall in any of the five is a link
error, not a review comment. It cost real design twice and both times the answer
was a second file rather than a weakened rule — the directory walk could not go
in `expand.cpp` and became `glob.cpp`, and `test`'s file primaries could not go
in `cond.cpp` and became `condrun.cpp`, which answers the probes the pure
evaluator names. That is what lets `test_parse.cpp`'s one-string `shape()`
compare check a whole parse, and `test_cond.cpp` check a whole expression
grammar against a table of canned answers, with no kernel in the loop. Anything
new that reaches `exec_node` goes the same way.

**The trajectory, since it is the only place the arithmetic is recorded.** Per
stage, in bytes of `sh.wasm`: 20,807, 10,644, 12,678, 14,607, 8,699, 13,897,
20,650, 26,270, 3,501. About twenty bytes of wasm per line of C++, which the
arena stages came in under and the coroutine ones over, and the estimate was
calibrated against the binary after S1 rather than guessed per stage — which is
why nine stages landed inside a budget that never moved. S8 also added
`/bin/test`, 19,246 of the tree on its own, because a builtin of the second kind
keeps its file.

**The integration cases are the last thing the per-stage tests could not do.**
Every block in `run.mjs` before this one stays inside one stage, so nothing
checked that the features *compose*. What checks it now is a planted script that
does something real — a function, an EXIT trap, a glob walked by `for`, a `case`
that skips an arm, a `$( )` with a redirection inside it, a here-document and a
nonzero exit — asserted whole, and it is the same script Programming_Manual.md
prints, so the manual's example cannot rot. Beside it are the seams: a function
body that globs with the *call* redirected, `case` inside `while` inside a
function, a `for` over a substitution under `set -e`, a builtin at each end of a
pipeline with a program between, `set -x` tracing inside a compound, and a
construct through `sh -c`. All of them passed the first time they were run,
which is the finding — the stages were composable as they landed, and this
proves rather than fixes it.

**Three instances at the peak, however many turns the loop takes.** The script's
cost is asserted rather than described: this shell, the script's own, and
whichever program is running. A shell that leaked an instance per turn, or
spawned the loop body in parallel, would fail that line — and it is the
counterpart to S8's assertion that a loop of builtins hires no worker at all.

---

## The shell got a front door

Tenth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `sh <file> args`, `sh -c cmd`,
`-e -x -u` at startup, `$0` and the positional parameters a shell begins with.
`sh.wasm` went from 211,737 to 215,238 bytes and the staging tree from 700,528
to 704,027 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget — 3,501 bytes over about 150 lines,
the cheapest stage of the ten. **`kernel.wasm` did not move**: 148,604 of
262,144, byte for byte what S7 left. The syscall ABI did not change and
`PROC_ABI` is still 10.

**A script file is read whole and parsed once, because that is what `.` already
did.** The alternative was the loop `sh -s` runs — a `LineReader` over the file,
accumulating until `line_incomplete` says the construct closed — and it is what
v7 does, executing as it parses. Two things decided against it. The smaller is
duplication: `sh_source` already reads a file with `read_file` and hands the
text to one parse, so `sh file` and `. file` are now the same mechanism and
cannot drift apart. The larger is stdin. A shell reading its script off stdin
has that stream open for two purposes at once, which is exactly the fidelity
loss S8 recorded for `read`; a script named on the command line has no such
conflict, and `while read l; do …; done` inside one reads the shell's actual
stdin. The cost is stated rather than hidden: a syntax error anywhere in the
file means none of the file runs, where v7 would have run everything above it.

**`sh -c cmd name args` names `$0` itself, and the arithmetic is v7's.** It is
tempting to make every word after the command string a positional parameter and
leave `$0` as `sh`, and that is wrong in the way that only shows up later:
`options()` and `main()` in the v7 port compute `cmdadr = dolv[0]` uniformly
across all three entry points, so `$0` is the script for a file, the first
operand for `-c`, and argv[0] otherwise. Following it means
`sh -c 'echo $0 $1' a b` prints `a b` here as everywhere else, and `sh -s a b`
puts `a` at `$1` rather than eating it. The implementation is `OptParse` plus
nine lines, since `var_init` plants `$0` and `args_set` carries it over — the
shell's own state was already the right shape and no new storage was added.

**`${x?}` now ends a non-interactive shell, which discharges a deferral.** *"The
shell got variables"* below records that `${x?}` "aborts the line rather than
the shell … because script-entry policy belongs to the stage that adds `sh file`
and `sh -c`". This is that stage, and v7's answer is taken: a script stops where
the parameter is missing rather than running on past a hole, while at a prompt
only the line is abandoned. It reuses `Flow::Exit` and so adds no exit path,
exactly as `set -e` did. Folding the decision in also collapsed four hand-copied
expansion-failure epilogues in [job.cpp](../src/cmd/sh/job.cpp) into one
`expand_failed`, which is where the `^C`-is-130 distinction now lives once
instead of four times.

**`#!` is settled rather than deferred.** `exec_meta` requires `\0asm` and a
`braam` custom section carrying `PROC_ABI`, so a text file can never be handed
to `Sys::Spawn`; there is no place to put an interpreter lookup that would not
be the kernel reading file contents to decide what a program is. `sh file` and
`sh < file` are the whole of it, and `./script.sh` will not arrive later —
**which it since has: "`#!` after all" above reverses this, and says why.**

---

## The rule grew a second clause

Ninth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `test`, `[`, `:`, `read`, `wait`,
`trap` and `set -e -x -u`, plus `echo`, `true` and `false`, which S8 as written
had ruled out. `sh.wasm` went from 185,467 to 211,737 bytes and the staging tree
from 654,945 to 700,528 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget — the extra being
`/bin/test`, a new binary at 19,246. **`kernel.wasm` did not move**: 148,604 of
262,144, byte for byte what S7 left. The syscall ABI did not change either, and
`PROC_ABI` is still 10.

**`test` is a builtin, and the reason is not the one TODO.md wrote down.** The
plan proposed "the shell's own state **or the condition of a loop**", drawn
narrowly enough to admit `test`, `[` and `:` and to exclude `echo` by name. That
wording does not survive the first request to add `echo`, and it was never the
real criterion: what makes `test` worth having inside the process is that a
program costs an instantiation and a worker — roughly a millisecond, §4.4 — and
`test` is two hundred lines of pure logic. The cost of running it *is* the
spawn. So the second clause is that, and it admits exactly the six commands
small enough for the statement to be true: `test`, `[`, `:`, `echo`, `true`,
`false`. A `while [ … ]; do echo …; done` paid two workers a turn and now pays
none, which `run.mjs` asserts by counting links across a five-turn loop.

**The file in `/bin` stays, and that is the other half of the amendment.** A
builtin of the first kind has no file and never will — there is nothing for
`/bin/cd` to do. A builtin of the second kind is a *shortcut*, so its file is
still the thing anything spawning by path gets: `/bin/test` now exists for a
future `find -exec`, and `/bin/echo`, `/bin/true` and `/bin/false` were not
deleted. TODO.md argued against shipping `/bin/test` as duplication for nothing;
the answer is that the duplication is the point, since the alternative is that
adding `find` later means adding `test` back. `help` prints each name once — the
builtin's line, because that is what typing the name runs.

**The expression is pure and the probing is not, and they had to be two files.**
v7's `test` is five mutually recursive functions, and three of its primaries —
`-r -w -x -f -d -s -t` — have to ask the filesystem. Making the recursion
coroutines would have cost a frame per nesting level against an allocator whose
top size class is 512 bytes. Instead [cond.cpp](../src/cmd/sh/cond.cpp) walks
the expression twice: once naming every file primary, then, with the answers in
hand, once more evaluating. It works because **v7's `-a` and `-o` are the
bitwise `&` and `|`** rather than the short-circuiting pair, so both sides of
every operator always evaluate and the two walks consume the same tokens in the
same order. The indices line up by construction, not by agreement between two
scanners — which is why collecting and evaluating are one function with a flag
rather than two. `cond.cpp` reaches no syscall, so it joins `parse.cpp` and
`expand.cpp` on the purity boundary and `test_cond.cpp` checks the whole grammar
against a table of answers. [condrun.cpp](../src/cmd/sh/condrun.cpp) is what
goes and looks; it touches no shell state, which is what lets `src/cmd/test.cpp`
build the binary out of the same two files rather than link `braam_sh`.

**Two primaries answer out of the gaps rather than out of a mode word.** There
are no file permissions and OPFS stores none, so `-r` is "it exists": everything
readable that is there. `-w` is v7's `tio(a, 1)` unchanged — open it for writing
and close it again — which asks the one question that has an answer here, since
`vfs_open` refuses `O_WRITE` on a read-only mount. It also inherits v7's answer
for a directory, which is *false*, because opening one for writing fails there
too. TODO.md proposed deriving it from `/proc/mounts` instead; the open probe is
shorter, exact, and needs no path normalisation. `-x` is true for a file whose
first four bytes are `\0asm`, because that is what `exec_meta` requires and
therefore what executable means here.

**`read` is where the shell reads past what it was asked for.** `Sys::Read`
carries no length — the reply is a whole chunk, whatever the writer wrote — so
there is no reading a line and leaving the rest. A file-scope `String` holds
what followed the newline, keyed by the descriptor it came off, and a `read` on
a different one drops it. Without that, `while read l; do …; done < file` would
see one line and stop, since a three-line file arrives in a single chunk. The
cost is that `sh -s` reading a script off stdin has its own `LineReader`
buffering separately, so a `read` inside such a script sees a different position
in the same stream; that is a real fidelity loss and it is the price of a
length-free read.

Interactively `read` needs nothing at all, which is worth recording because it
looks like it should. `exec_pipeline` gives the keyboard back before any builtin
runs and takes it again after, so for exactly the window a builtin is awake the
console pump has no raw claimant and is cooking lines into this shell's stdin —
and doing the echo.

**`wait` puts the job in front, and v7's does not.** There are no signals, so
being in the foreground set is the only way a `^C` can reach anything; a `wait`
that did not would park the shell on a job with no way out. That makes `wait %n`
the same call `fg %n` makes, minus the echo of the command line, and
`builtin_fg` is now the thin one.

**`trap` has two signals because there are two things that can happen.**
`trap … 0` fires from the `shell()` funnel, whatever ended the loop. `trap … 2`
fires from the one place a `^C` becomes a status — `exec_pipeline`'s epilogue,
where 130 already becomes `Flow::Interrupt` — and only in an interactive shell,
where the interrupt went to the stages and this process was never cancelled. In
a script the process itself is cancelled and `CancelState::cancelled` is sticky,
so every await from that point answers `Err(Cancelled)` and a handler could
neither spawn nor write. It is accepted rather than worked around, and
`trap '' 2` is **refused outright** for the same reason: nothing can decline a
cancellation that has already been delivered, and accepting the syntax while
ignoring it would be worse than saying so. A trap is *taken* rather than read
before it runs, so an action cannot fire itself and a `trap` inside one replaces
it.

**`set -e` needed a counter, not a flag.** The rule is not "a nonzero status
ends the shell" but "a nonzero status that nobody asked about ends the shell",
and the four places that ask are an `if` condition, a loop condition, `!`'s
operand and every element of an `&&`/`||` chain but the last. `Ctx` gained a
`cond` depth incremented around exactly those, and the test itself sits at the
end of `exec_node`, where every node's status passes through once. It reuses
`Flow::Exit`, so `set -e` adds no exit path — `exit` already owned that one.

**`set -u` is a field on `Vars`, not a callback.** A lookup cannot tell a bare
`$x` from the one inside `${x-y}`: only the walk knows that the operators asked
first and are exempt. Making it data keeps
[expand.cpp](../src/cmd/sh/expand.cpp) pure, so the rule is checked in
`test_expand.cpp` with the rest of the expander. The check went into `named` and
`positional` rather than `emit`, because a bare `$x` reaches those two straight
from `dollar()`.

**One gap got wider, and it is the price of the second clause.**
`while true; do echo x; done` used to be interruptible, because `true` and
`echo` were programs and the shell armed them with `Sys::Fg`. Both are builtins
now, so that loop has no child in the foreground set, no `^C` reaches anything,
and `rt.h` is explicit that nothing cancels from inside a process. A loop with a
program still in it — `while true; do sleep 100; done` — is interrupted in one
press, and the escape from the other kind is still killing the shell, which init
replaces. The alternative was leaving `true` a binary and paying a worker a turn
for the one shape of loop that most needs not to; the gap is recorded rather
than traded for.

`$-` came with the letters, and cost `-` its place as an ordinary byte: it is a
special parameter now, so `$-` is the options and no longer a literal `$-`. The
flags are one word, which is what makes them one more field on `( … )`'s
checkpoint — TODO.md's subshell row promised `(set -e; …)` isolation and this is
what pays it.

## The ABI changed, once

Eighth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: here-documents, `>&`, `exec`
redirections, inherited base stdio and `( … )` as a state checkpoint. `sh.wasm`
went from 164,817 to 185,467 bytes and the staging tree from 634,295 to 654,945
against an unchanged 1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm` moved for the first time in
this plan** — 148,483 to 148,604 of 262,144 — because this is the stage that had
to add an operation.

**`Sys::Dup`, and it was `exec` rather than `2>&1` that forced it.** The plan of
record promised no syscall changes, and that promise held for seven stages. What
breaks it is not the obvious thing: `cmd 2>&1` already worked, since
`ChildIo{.err = SYS_STDOUT}` is resolved by the kernel against the parent's own
stream, and a builtin merging two streams is one integer assignment. It is
`exec >file`. `Spawn` **moves** a descriptor — that is what closes a pipe's
write end and gives the reader its end of input — so the shell's own base
descriptor would be gone into the first child that ran. Nothing in a
thirty-seven-operation table can stand in for a duplicate.

It cost less than the promise suggested. Ops 25–31 were free before
`Sleep = 32`, so `Dup` renumbers nothing; a new operation is an enum value on
each side rather than a new import, so `smoke`'s exact per-binary import surface
stayed green untouched, which is the whole point of multiplexing `sys_async`.
`PROC_ABI` went 9 → 10 and `exec_meta` refuses anything older, so a stale binary
is a diagnostic.

**One rule had to be relaxed, and it turned out to be a rule that never said
what it meant.** `Spawn` refused to move a handle with `refs > 1`, and its
comment said "nothing this process is inside a syscall on". Those are different
things the moment a second *descriptor* can exist: every dup'd fd would have
been unspawnable. The condition it always meant is recorded on the handle as
`busy_r`/`busy_w`, so the test moved there and the comment finally describes the
code. `Handle` also gained an `fds` count beside `refs`, because closing one of
two descriptors must shut nothing.

**The here-doc cliff did not exist.** TODO.md specified a `/tmp` file with a
unique name, a path tracked on `Run`, a field on `JobEntry` and a reap in
`jobs_report`, all to avoid "a hard cliff at 8 × 512 = 4,096 bytes". That is the
`PIPE_SLOTS` misreading corrected at S5, a second time: `pipe_write` puts a
whole `Str` into **one** slot, and a single `Sys::Write` carries up to
`SYS_STAGE_MAX` = 1 MB. So a here-doc is a pipe — write the body, close the
write end, hand the read end over — and every piece of the temp-file machinery
was deleted before it was written. Two stages in a row have now been simplified
by reading `PIPE_SLOTS` correctly; the comment on it says "chunks, not bytes"
and means writes.

**The body is collected at parse time and nothing else may be.**
`line_incomplete` re-parses the whole accumulated text on every line the user
adds, and `run_line` parses it again — so collection has to be a pure function
of the text. Creating the pipe in the parser would have made one per keystroke
line. The body is stored as the redirection's *target*, because `Tree`'s target
table is an arbitrary byte store rather than a filename table, and the pipe is
made where the other descriptors are.

Two rules fall out of the accumulator's shape rather than from any
specification. The text never ends in a newline — `shell.cpp` joins lines with
one — so a delimiter at the very end of the text must count as terminated, or
the prompt asks forever. And an unterminated body has to fail with `more` set,
which is what puts `PS2` on the screen.

**A here-doc expands but does not unquote**, and that needed no change to the
expander. The body is escaped — every `'`, `"` and `\` gets a backslash — before
`expand_one` sees it, so `$` acts and the quotes come back out as themselves. A
quoted delimiter skips even that.

**Pipes now run before redirections, and that is a fix, not a rearrangement.**
`ls /nope 2>&1 | wc` must send stderr into the pipe, and `2>&1` copies whatever
`out` holds *at that moment* — which was still the terminal, because the pipe
was attached afterwards. The order is now pipes, redirections, capture.
`a > f | b` is unchanged: the redirection displaces the write end and closes it,
so `b` still gets a clean end of input.

**`ours()` is the whole of what changed for base stdio.** It decided what a
stage may close by `fd >= SYS_FD_MIN`, and a base descriptor of 7 breaks that
assumption everywhere at once — the replace-on-second-redirection, the
per-builtin close, the final sweep. It takes the base now, and the three
hard-wired constants in the pipe and capture tests became comparisons against
it. That is the entire mechanism, and it lifts S6's function refusal for free:
`f | wc` and `f > log` work because `call_func` already ran the body on the
caller's `Ctx`, which now carries the stage's descriptors.

**A compound may be redirected but still not piped**, and the split is where the
grammar is. A compound's own redirections ride on a synthetic `Command` named by
the node's spare `d` field, so `{ a; } > f` and `for … done > f` needed a parser
arm and an `exec_node` prologue. Piping one is a different change: a `Pipe`
node's stages are *commands*, and making them nodes is its own work. The refusal
narrowed rather than went.

**`( … )` restores everything but the job table.** cwd through two syscalls, the
positional parameters through the `args_swap` `call_func` already used, the
variables through a new `vars_swap`, and the function table through a snapshot
that holds each body's tree — a redefinition mutates an entry in place rather
than growing the vector, so a mark-and-truncate would have missed it. `(exit 3)`
reports 3 and the shell lives, caught at the boundary the way `call_func`
catches `Flow::Return`.

The job table is deliberately shared: the children are this same process's and
must still be reaped, so restoring it would leak kernel child slots and break
`jobs_report`. And `exec` *is* in the checkpoint, which is not obvious until you
look for the way back — there is no `/dev/tty` and no way to name the stream the
shell was handed, so `exec >file` at the top level is irreversible. Inside
`( … )` it is not, and that is the only place it can be tested.

**`>&-` is refused rather than faked.** Saying "this stream is closed" needs a
value the Spawn payload does not have and a null *sink* the kernel does not have
— `null_source` exists for input only. A gap to record.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_parse.cpp` renders a here-doc's
collected body as one string compare, including two on one line taken in order,
`<<-`'s tabs, a quoted delimiter, and both unterminated forms asking for more.
`test/run.mjs` has what the tree cannot show: a here-doc typed over three lines
with `PS2` on the screen, `2>&1` reaching a pipe and a file, a compound and a
function redirected, and a subshell putting back a cwd, a variable, the
parameters, a function and a redefinition.

---

## A line could outlive itself

Seventh of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `name() { … }`, `.`, `eval`, `return`
and `unset -f`. `sh.wasm` went from 150,920 to 164,817 bytes and the staging
tree from 620,398 to 634,295 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm`
did not move and the syscall ABI did not change.**

**This is the first stage with no reference to port.** The V7 shell has no
functions and no `return` — both arrived with SVR2, five years later — so where
every stage before this one could be checked against
`/Users/vak/Project/Besm-6/v7besm/cmd/sh/`, this one is POSIX by choice. What v7
*does* have is `.` and `eval`, and its shape was worth keeping: one `execexp()`
that pushes an input source and runs it in the current everything. `run_text` is
that function, and `.` and `eval` differ only in where the text comes from.

**A function body outlives its line, and that is the whole of the difficulty.**
Every stage until now could assume a parse dies with the text it came from. The
tree is already heap-allocated — S3 put it there — so the change is a count, not
an allocation. What it could *not* be is a destructor: `Tree`'s move constructor
is implicit, `test_parse.cpp` asserts a frozen tree still moves, and declaring
`~Tree` would delete that move and fall back to the deleted copy. So the count
is a plain `mutable u32 refs` with `tree_hold`/`tree_release` beside it, and a
stack `Tree` — `line_incomplete`, the tests — never touches either.

**The second half of that lifetime is the text, and it is easy to miss.**
`Tree::line_` is a *view* of the line, not a copy, and `text()` over it is what
`jobs` lists. A tree pinned by a function outlives its line, so `own_source()`
copies the text into the tree and repoints the view — called only when
`defines()` says a `FuncDef` was added, which `add_node` records as it goes.
Without it a background job started inside a function would list freed memory,
which is the kind of bug that shows up as a garbled `jobs` months later.

**Telling `f() { … }` from `f arg` needs one token of lookahead the parser did
not have**, and `simple()` adds the name to the store on its first iteration
with no way to take it back. So `pipeline()` eats the name itself and hands it
on: to `func_def` if a `(` follows, to `simple(name, true)` otherwise. Two
orderings are load-bearing. `compound()` keeps first refusal, because **every
keyword is also a name** — without that, `case x in …` had `case` eaten as a
function name and forty-nine tests failed at once. And a `(` with anything but
`)` after it is reported as `syntax error near '('` rather than `expected ')'`,
so `echo (x)` still says what it said before: it was never a definition.

`(` and `)` cost nothing here, having become tokens at S4 for `case`'s arms.
That is twice now that stage has paid for itself.

**The body runs on the caller's `Ctx`, which is a deliberate trade.** It is what
gives the body the caller's capture, keyboard and depth bound for free — so
`x=$(f)` works with nothing added, and a runaway recursion reports
`too deeply nested` rather than overflowing the wasm stack. The price is that a
function is not a scope: `break` inside one reaches a loop outside it, and its
variables are the shell's. There is no fork, so the alternative is the
save-and-restore checkpoint S7 owes `( list )`, and doing it twice is how the
two would drift.

**What the call does save is the positional parameters**, and `var.cpp` gained
one primitive for it: `args_swap` exchanges the whole block and hands back what
was there. `$#` is derived from the vector's size, so restoring one restores the
other.

**`Flow::Return` was almost free.** `loop_step` already passes anything that is
not `Break` or `Continue` straight through, so a `return` unwinds `while`,
`for`, `case`, `if` and `{ }` with no change to any of them; only the call site
notices it and clears it back to `Normal`. `Ctx::frames` counts function calls
and sourced files together, so `return` outside both is a silent no-op — the
rule `break` outside a loop already follows.

**A function is looked up before a builtin and before `/bin`**, which is ksh's
order and POSIX's. It costs three edits, all at gates `Stage` already had. What
it does *not* yet get is a pipe or a redirection: the body would write to the
shell's own stdout, because `exec_pipeline`'s base stdio is still hard-wired, so
`f | wc` is refused with the message `{ a; } | wc` has had since S3. S7 threads
the base stdio and lifts both at once.

**`ShIo` still has no `Ctx`, and did not need one.** `.` and `eval` reach the
walk through `sh_source` and `sh_eval` in `job.h`, over a file-scope pointer to
the walk in progress that `exec_pipeline` saves and restores around each
builtin. That is the shape `loop_break` and `shell_exit` have had all along, and
it kept `Ctx` private to one file rather than publishing a type that two
builtins out of sixteen need.

**One test bug worth recording, because it is a property of the feature.** A
case proving a function shadows `/bin` defined `echo() { true; }` — and a
definition outlives its line, so every later case in the file silently printed
nothing. Both shadowing cases now `unset -f` on the same line. A language where
definitions persist needs its tests to clean up after themselves, which no
earlier stage did.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_parse.cpp` renders `fn(name){body}`
as one string compare per form — no space needed before `(`, a newline before
the body, any compound as the body — plus the three refusals. `test/run.mjs` has
what the tree cannot show: that `$1` and `$#` are the call's and go back
afterwards, that a redefinition wins, that `return` carries a status out through
a loop, that a function shadows both a builtin and `/bin`, that `unset -f`
really removes one, and that a function defined in a sourced file is still
callable after the `.` returned.

## A word could run a command

Sixth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `$( )` and the backtick, the pipe the
shell drains itself, and the hook that lets a pure expander reach an impure
command. `sh.wasm` went from 142,221 to 150,920 bytes and the staging tree from
611,699 to 620,398 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm` did not
move and the syscall ABI did not change** — `Sys::Pipe` has been there since M6,
and until now `watch` was its only caller.

**The expander gives up rather than becoming a coroutine.** Running a command
needs a `co_await`; `expand.cpp` is synchronous, and it is compiled into
`tests.wasm` precisely because it reaches no syscall. So `Vars` took a fifth
callback that hands back what a substitution *printed*, and when nobody has that
yet the walk abandons the whole word with `Err(Again)`, naming the command and
the byte where it began. `job.cpp` runs it, files the output under that offset,
and expands again.

That is only correct because the walk is idempotent, and it is idempotent for
one specific reason: `${x=$(a)}` gives up **inside** the operator's body, before
`v.set` is reached, so the retry finds x still unset and takes the same branch.
Every other operator only reads. The word is walked once per substitution in it
— one or two in practice — and the alternative, collecting every substitution in
a single pass and re-expanding once, is what does *not* work: it would have to
commit a placeholder for `${x=$(a)}`, and the second pass would then see x set
and take the other branch.

The property the TODO asked for falls out with nothing added: `${x-$(cmd)}` runs
the command exactly once and only when the branch is taken, because the
operator's word is only ever walked on the branch that takes it.
`test_expand.cpp` proves it with a call counter rather than by reading the code.

**The offset that keys the memo needs no plumbing.** Every recursion in the
expander — a `"…"` body, a `${x-…}` body — is over a *substring* of the raw
word, so subtracting the two data pointers gives the absolute offset and no base
has to be threaded through `run`, `dollar` and `braced`. The unit tests assert
it through both nestings, which is the only way that trick stays honest.

**TODO.md's reason for `ShIo::capture` was wrong, so the field was not
written.** It said a builtin inside `$( )` would "fill eight chunks with nobody
left to drain them". `PIPE_SLOTS` counts **writes**, not 512-byte chunks:
`pipe_write` puts a whole `Str` into one slot and returns its full size, so a
builtin that buffers and writes once — which is `builtin.h`'s standing rule, and
what all six output builtins do — uses one slot of eight and never parks. The
last stage takes the capture pipe whether it is a builtin or a program,
`builtin.h` and its six call sites did not change, and the rule there gained the
second reason it is now load-bearing for. `builtin.h` also had "eight chunks"
and now says what it counts.

**Drained before the wait, and `watch` had already written the paragraph.** A
child parked in a full pipe has not exited, so collecting statuses first is a
deadlock only `^C` could break. The drain goes between the builtin loop and the
wait loop, which is the one seam where the shell holds the read end and nothing
else: a program stage's write end was *moved* into it by `spawn`, and a
builtin's was closed by `close_stage` the moment its turn ended. `run.mjs` runs
7,077 bytes through it — fourteen chunks against eight slots — which is the case
that hangs rather than fails if the two are ever swapped.

One capture pipe per *pipeline*, not per line. `$(a; b)` makes one for each and
drains each before the next runs, so the outputs concatenate in order and at
most one message is ever queued; one pipe for the whole list could not see
end-of-input until the list was over.

**`"$(echo "a b")"` forced a real fix.** A `$(…)` inside double quotes quotes
independently, and both scanners looked for the closing `"` byte by byte — so
the inner quote ended the outer run and the word broke in the wrong place. The
lexer's scan and the expander's now skip a `$(…)` whole, using the same
`paren_end` they use everywhere else. `brace_end` was already the precedent for
sharing a scan rather than keeping two copies; `paren_end` and `tick_end` join
it in `tokenize.h`.

**A substitution is not a subshell, and cannot be.** There is no fork, so the
command runs in this shell: `$(cd /x)` moves it and `$(y=1)` sets a real
variable. What *is* contained is containable without one — the command is parsed
and run against its own `Tree` and its own `Ctx` rather than through `run_line`,
which would clear a pending `break` and let `$(exit)` end the shell. The inner
`Ctx` carries the outer's depth, so `$($($(…)))` is bounded like any other nest,
and inherits `interactive`, so `^C` reaches the command and comes back as
`Err(Cancelled)` — which the expansion path already turned into 130 at S4. The
rest is in CLAUDE.md's gaps, waiting for the checkpoint S7 has to write for
`( list )` anyway.

**Trailing newlines go, which is not a detail.** `x=$(pwd)` must not put a
newline in x, and every shell since v7 strips them. Everything else about the
output falls out of `put_value`: unquoted it splits against IFS and is left
**unmarked**, so a `*` out of a command globs exactly as one out of a variable
does; inside `"…"` it is marked and unsplit. That is one call, and it is the
whole of the quoting behaviour.

**Nothing bounds the captured output** but the process's 16 MB cap, which is
v7's answer too. `watch` stops appending at 32 KB because it only paints a
screen; a substitution that truncated would corrupt a value with no way to tell.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_tokenize.cpp` has the balanced scans
— nesting, a `)` inside quotes, a backtick run inside double quotes, and both
unterminated forms reaching the continuation prompt. `test_expand.cpp` has the
hook against canned answers: the splitting, the mark, the stripped newlines, the
call counter, and `Err(Again)` reporting the right offset through a quote and
through an operator body. `run.mjs` has what neither can:
`$(ls /bin | grep less)` through a real pipeline, a builtin down the same pipe,
a nested substitution, `$(pwd)` with no newline, and the 7,077-byte drain.

---

## A word became a pattern

Fifth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `*`, `?`, `[a-z]` and `[!…]` over the
real store, and `case`/`esac` with its arms. `sh.wasm` went from 127,614 to
142,221 bytes and the staging tree from 597,092 to 611,699 against an unchanged
1 MiB budget — 58% of it. **`kernel.wasm` did not move and the syscall ABI did
not change**; a directory listing is `Sys::List`, which `ls` has been calling
since M5.

The two features ship together because they are one matcher. A `case` pattern
*is* a glob pattern, and writing the matcher twice is how the two would disagree
about what `[a-` means.

**This is the first reader the quoting mask has, and the mask was right.** S1
built `Field::mark` one byte per byte with these two consumers named in the
header and nothing using it for two stages; `test_expand.cpp` has asserted since
then that `$star` yields an *unmarked* `*` where `'*'`, `"*"` and `\*` yield a
marked one. Globbing needed no change to the expander at all — `glob_match`
takes the mark as its second argument and a marked metacharacter matches itself.
The alternative, deciding at expansion time whether a word "looks like a
pattern", is what shells that have no mask do, and it is why they cannot tell
`$x` holding a star from a typed one.

**The walk could not go where the plan put it.** TODO.md said the directory walk
belongs in `expand.cpp`. It cannot: `list_dir` is a coroutine, and `expand.cpp`
is compiled into `tests.wasm` precisely because it reaches no syscall — the link
is what enforces that, not a promise. So the matcher is `match.cpp`, pure and in
`tests.wasm` beside the parser and the expander, and the walk is `glob.cpp`, in
`braam_sh` alone. The purity boundary is the thing being protected here, and it
survived by splitting the file rather than by weakening the rule. S5's
`substitute`/`glob` pair is the same argument one step further on.

**The matcher does not follow v7's `gmatch`, and the reason is the pattern the
tests name.** V7 recurses once per `*`, and the port this work follows already
turned its other three tail calls into loop iterations. Both forms are
exponential in *time* on `a*a*a*b`: every star re-tries every suffix
independently. A single `*` class is the whole of this pattern language, so one
saved backtrack point — the last star and the offset it was tried at — answers
it, in a loop, with no recursion left to bound. `test_match.cpp` runs `a*a*a*b`
against thirty `a`s, which the recursive form would not finish.

**Three answers where v7 and POSIX differ, decided the way S3 decided its
three.** A leading dot must be asked for, and a *quoted* dot counts: `\.*` lists
dotfiles here where v7 lists nothing, because every shell since has done so and
the rule is shorter to state. An unterminated `[` matches nothing rather than
being taken literally — that is v7's answer, and it costs nothing visible, since
a word that matches nothing is used as it was written. And a component that is
not the last must be a directory, so `echo */` lists directories and `a*/b`
never tries to descend into a file.

**No sort was needed, which the plan did not expect.** `vfs_list` has sorted its
entries in case-free byte order since M5 — `ls` relies on it and says so.
Prefixes are walked in order and each listing arrives ordered, so a
multi-component glob comes out ordered without a comparison anywhere in
`glob.cpp`. TODO.md had budgeted an insertion sort for it.

**`(` and `)` became operators, which is S7's lexer work done early.** A `case`
arm ends in `)`, and until now that was an ordinary word byte — `a)` lexed as
one word. The parser could have stripped the trailing byte inside `case_clause`
and left the lexer alone, but that misreads `case x in a\)` and cannot accept
POSIX's optional leading `(`. So `is_operator` took both, and the price is that
`echo (x)` is now `syntax error near '('` instead of printing `(x)`. Every real
shell says the same thing, and `( list )` — which S7 has to run as a state
checkpoint, there being no fork — now lexes already. `parse()`'s trailing
diagnostic stopped saying "unexpected keyword" for a token that is not a word,
so `;;` alone reports itself rather than being called a keyword.

**Only argv words are globbed.** An assignment value and a redirection target
expand under `Split::One` — one field in, one field out by definition — and
globbing them would break that contract for no gain worth having; `> *.txt` is a
refusal to write into a pattern rather than a silent single match. `for`'s word
list *is* globbed, which cost one call, because S3 put its words through the
command expander for exactly this.

**`expand_all` became a coroutine, and that is the whole of the cost to the job
runtime.** It expands a command's raw words into a scratch vector and hands that
to `glob_fields`, which appends to `Run::words`; `argv0[i]` is still pushed
before the command's words, so the slice arithmetic nothing else knows about did
not change. A `^C` caught mid-listing arrives as `Error::Cancelled` out of the
expansion, which is the one error that must not print "out of memory" — it
reports 130 and abandons the line, through the path a stage reporting 130
already took.

**`case` is not a loop and must not look like one.** Its arms are a flat run of
(patterns, body) pairs in the child list, as `if`'s branches are, for the
third-and-fourth time the same reason: in this executor depth costs coroutine
frames. It never touches `cx.loops`, so a `break` in an arm belongs to whatever
loop is above it, and a `case` that matches no arm reports 0 with an explicit
`var_status(0)` — the rule `if` needed when it took no branch, since nothing ran
and so nothing published a status. v7's literal-compare fallback after a failed
`gmatch` is not reproduced: a marked metacharacter already matches itself, which
is what that fallback was for.

**A generated name carries a mask of its own.** `Field` promises one mark byte
per text byte, and a name off the store has to keep that promise even though
nothing reads it again — it is marked literal throughout, so no later stage can
take a `?` in a filename for a pattern.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_match.cpp` is the matcher alone
against table literals, including the quoted star, the quoted `-` inside a live
class, the unterminated `[`, and the pathological pattern; `test_parse.cpp`
renders `case` as one string compare per construct, with the empty arm and the
arm whose last `;;` is spared; `test/run.mjs` has what neither can reach — that
`echo /bin/l*` names two real files, that `/home/g/.*` finds the dotfile that
`/home/g/*` must not, that a star out of a variable globs and a quoted one does
not, and that `case` runs a real body. The glob block sits late in `run.mjs` on
purpose: every command spends pids, and the `ps` cases above it assert a column
width that a five-digit pid overruns.

---

## The tree learned to branch

Fourth of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`: `if`/`elif`/`else`/`fi`, `while`,
`until`, `for … in`, `break` and `continue`. `sh.wasm` went from 114,936 to
127,614 bytes and the staging tree from 584,414 to 597,092 against an unchanged
1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm` did not move and the syscall ABI did not change.**

A correction to the two entries below this one, since it is a measurement and
not a judgement: both were taken on a build tree still holding the `/bin/export`
that S1 renamed to `save`, which `copy_directory` never deletes. Clean, S2 ended
at 584,414 rather than the 599,238 recorded there. CLAUDE.md already warns that
a release is cut from a clean tree; so, it turns out, is a number.

**Almost nothing new had to be invented, which is the point of having built S2
first.** The node arena took four kinds, `Flow` took two values, and
`break`/`continue` went in as builtins through the path `exit` already used — a
flag the builtin sets, turned into a `Flow` by the pipeline it ran in, consumed
by the loop above. `builtin.h`'s rule needed no amendment: what they touch is
this process's own walk.

**`if` is a flat run of (condition, body) pairs where v7 nests.** The V7 shell
desugars `elif` into a nested `TIF` as the else-branch, which is elegant in a
shell that unwinds with `longjmp` and wrong in one whose walk is a chain of
coroutine frames: `elif` nine times would be nine frames deep. It is the same
argument that made `Seq` and the `&&` chain n-ary in the stage before, and it is
now the third time it has come up, so it is worth naming — **in this executor,
depth costs frames, so anything that reads as a chain must be stored as one.**

**Three places where POSIX won over the reference, all deliberate.** An `if`
whose condition fails with no `else` reports 0; v7 reports the *condition's*
status, because its `execute()` zeroes `exitval` only for a non-null tree and
the missing else-branch is a null one. That is a bug every shell since has
fixed, and scripts have assumed the fix for forty years. `for x in; do … done`
is legal with an empty list where v7's `chkword` refuses it. And `continue n`
takes a level, which v7 parses for `break` and ignores for `continue`.

One v7 behaviour was deliberately *not* reproduced: `break 9` inside one loop
leaves its level counter set after the outermost loop exits, and nothing there
ever clears it, so the rest of the script is silently skipped. `run_line` clears
the request on the way out, so it can spill into the rest of a line but never
into the next one.

**A loop lets `Flow::Interrupt` through rather than consuming it**, and that one
line is what makes `while true; do sleep 5; done` come back on a single `^C`
instead of one press per iteration. `Break` and `Continue` are the only two a
loop takes; `Exit` and `Interrupt` pass through to `run_line`. The gap it leaves
is now in CLAUDE.md: a loop whose body is *entirely* builtins has nowhere for a
`^C` to go, because the shell arms its children with `Sys::Fg` and is never in
its own foreground set. Every `while true` has a program in it today, since
`true` is `/bin/true`, so the gap only opens when S8 makes `:` and `test`
builtins — which is the stage that has to argue for them.

**A construct that runs nothing has to say so.** `exec_pipeline` is what
publishes `$?`, so an `if` that took no branch and a loop whose body never ran
would have left the *condition's* status visible even though they report 0. Both
call `var_status` on that path and only that path — the same shape the `!`
operator already needed.

**`for`'s name and word list are a `Command`**, so the expander that serves a
command serves them too and `for i in $files` splits against `IFS` for free,
with globbing to follow at S4 with nothing added. The one catch was that
`add_word` counts a leading `name=value` as an assignment prefix, which would
have hidden `for i in x=1` from `args()`; the fix is a defaulted parameter that
the `for` words pass false. Its items are copied before the loop starts, because
a `set` or `shift` in the body would otherwise move the vector being walked — v7
takes a reference on the parameter block for exactly that reason.

**Reserved words are recognised by position and quoting is handled by doing
nothing.** `ends_list` is consulted only where a command may start, and
`simple()` takes words greedily, so `echo done` prints `done` and
`while true do …` reads `do` as an argument to `true` — which is v7's behaviour
and why the `;` is mandatory. And because a word still carries its quotes at
that point, `'do'` is four bytes and can never match the two-byte keyword.

**Two things cost more time than the feature did.** A conditional expression
choosing between string literals — `w == "then" ? "…" : "…"` — is not a constant
pointer, so `Str`'s `__builtin_strlen` did not fold and the link failed on
`strlen` with no libc to satisfy it. The codebase already had that comment in
`job.cpp`; it now has it twice. And a driver case that types a 63-character
command in one burst overflows the 64-slot key ring and loses its Enter, which
looks exactly like a hung shell. A human types slowly enough never to see it.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_parse.cpp` renders the four
constructs, so `if` with an `elif` chain, a nested loop and a `for` with and
without its `in` are each one string compare; `test/run.mjs` has what the tree
cannot show — that a loop rebinds its variable, that `break 2` leaves both loops
and nothing else, that `break` outside a loop is silent, and that
`if false; then echo x; fi` reports 0.

## A line became a tree

Third of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`, and the one it called the largest. `;`,
`&&`, `||`, `&` mid-line, `#` comments, `!`, `{ … ; }`, a newline as a
separator, and a half-typed construct that asks for another line under `PS2`.
`sh.wasm` went from 104,292 to 114,936 bytes and the staging tree from 588,594
to 599,238 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm` did not move and
the syscall ABI did not change**; `smoke`'s exact import and export surface
stayed green untouched, which is what says so.

**`Pipeline` became `Tree`.** It already owned the store, the words and the
commands; now it owns the nodes above them, and a class named for one of the
kinds it holds would have been read wrong by every stage after this one. The
rename is the whole of `parse.{h,cpp}`, `job.cpp` and `test_parse.cpp`, and it
is cheaper now than at any later point.

**The arena is index links, for the reason `freeze()` already gave.** `nodes_`,
`kids_` and `ops_` all reallocate while the parse grows, so a pointer into any
of them dangles at the next push. Indices also keep a frozen tree trivially
movable, which `test_parse.cpp` asserts and which a function body will depend
on. `nodes_[0]` is always a `Nop`, so an index of 0 can mean "nothing" without a
sentinel of its own — an empty line is a tree whose root is 0.

**`&&` and `||` are one n-ary chain, not a left-leaning pair per link, and that
is a *depth* decision rather than a tidiness one.** `exec_node` recurses, so
`And(And(And(a,b),c),d)` would make `a && b && c && d` four frames deep and a
hundred links a hundred frames. As one chain with a byte of operator per link,
the walk's depth is the *text's nesting* depth — braces, `!`, and later `if`,
`while` and a function — which is what the parser's bound of 16 actually bounds.
`Seq` is n-ary for the same reason, so a hundred-statement script is depth one.

The short circuit is a `continue` and not a `break`, and the difference is
`false && a || b`: the `&&` skips `a`, and the status carries down the chain so
the `||` still reaches `b`. Breaking out would have stopped the whole chain at
the first failure, which is a different language.

**Control transfer is a field, because there are no exceptions.**
`enum class Flow { Normal, Exit, Interrupt }` on a `Ctx`, checked after every
`co_await exec_node(…)` — one branch per node, the same shape as `TRY()`.
`Break`, `Continue` and `Return` join it when there is something to break out
of.

`exit` is the case that shows why a field and not a return value. It was already
a builtin that *asks* rather than acts, setting a flag the prompt loop reads at
the end of a line; with a list, `echo a; exit; echo b` would have run `echo b`
before anyone looked. So `exec_pipeline` consumes the flag where the builtin
ran, turns it into `Flow::Exit`, and `run_line` re-arms it on the way out.
`shell.cpp`'s two loops did not change a line for it.

`Flow::Interrupt` was scheduled for the next stage, with the loops. It came here
instead because `;` is what makes it reachable: without it `sleep 5; echo done`
echoes after a `^C`. A stage reporting 130 stops the rest of the text, and
`job.h` now says why that is the mechanism — there is no signal, and a status is
the only thing that crosses a process boundary. The price is stated there too: a
program that exits 130 of its own accord does the same.

**`Ctx` is its own heap block, and so is the tree.** `Run` held the `Pipeline`
by value, and it could not: the tree outlives every pipeline under it.
`run_line` allocates the tree, `Run` borrows it and shrank by half as a result.
`Ctx` is thirty-odd bytes today and did not have to be on the heap — but it
grows with every stage left (break levels, traps, a scope, the `-e -x -u`
flags), and `run_line`'s frame is the root of a recursion. Putting it there now
freezes that frame instead of letting each later stage push it a little closer
to the 512-byte cliff.

One `Run` per pipeline, `heap_new`'d and freed as each runs, rather than one
cleared and reused: `Vec` has no capacity-preserving `clear()`, ten of them
would have to be got right every time, and command substitution will want two
`Run`s alive at once anyway.

**Multi-line input is re-parsing, and v7's best idea was rejected on its own
merits.** The V7 shell serves `.`, `eval`, traps, `-c`, substitution and
here-documents through one `fileblk` chain — a single character source that can
block. Here that would make the lexer a coroutine and the recursive-descent
parser a stack of them, five frames deep on every word against a 512-byte
budget, and it would drag `sys_async` into `parse.cpp`, which `tests.wasm`
compiles precisely because it touches nothing but `Str`, `String` and `Vec`.

So `parse()` gained a third outcome instead: `ParseErr{ message, more }`, where
`more` means the text ended *inside* something. Both readers accumulate and
re-parse from the top — the prompt under `Prompt{ {}, {}, ps2 }`, which
`LineEditor` needed no change at all to draw, since a `Prompt` was already three
independent pieces; and `sh -s` over `LineReader`, one line at a time, so
`producer | sh -s` still streams rather than blocking to EOF. It is quadratic in
the length of one construct, and a construct is tens of lines against a pure
parser that allocates into a store it throws away. `more` is deliberately *not*
a new `Error` value: that enum is kernel-wide.

`more` is set where the operator was — a trailing `|`, `&&` or `||`, an unclosed
`{`, an unterminated quote or `${` — and never by a command that simply had no
words. `> f` is a syntax error at once; `a &&` waits.

**A newline stopped being whitespace**, which is one asymmetry and no more: the
lexer's leading skip takes a new `is_blank` that excludes `\n`, while the
word-terminating test keeps `is_space`, which already included it. `#` starts a
comment only where a token could start, so `echo a#b` is still one word. `{`,
`}` and `!` stay ordinary word bytes and are reserved by *position* — and
because a word still carries its quotes at that point, `'{'` is three bytes and
can never match the one-byte reserved word, so quoting is handled by doing
nothing.

**Two refusals, both for the same reason.** `a && b &` and `{ … ; } &` are
`cannot run a list in the background`: backgrounding means the shell keeps
running while the rest goes, and nothing in a process can wait for a sibling
task, so there would be nobody left to run `b`. What may be backgrounded is one
pipeline whose stages are all spawned children. And `{ a; } | wc` and
`{ a; } > f` are refused as *not yet* — a group needs the base stdio threaded
through `Ctx`, which is the redirection stage's work, and doing it twice is how
the two would drift.

**`jobs` now lists a pipeline's own text.** The `JobEntry` copied the whole
line, which was the same thing when a line was one pipeline; with
`echo hi; sleep 5 &` it would have filed the lot. Each `Pipe` node carries the
byte span it came from, which is two of the four fields a node has spare, and
the `&` falls outside it — so the listing reads `sleep 5`, which is what it
always should have said.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_parse.cpp`'s `shape()` grew from a
loop over stages to a walk over the tree, and every construct is one string
compare again: `{a};{b}`, `{a}&&{b}||{c}`, `!{a}`, `{{a};{b}}`, and `?` rather
than `!` in front of a message when the text merely ended early. `test/run.mjs`
has the four things the unit suite cannot see: that `false && a || b` reaches
`b`, that `$?` is the *pipeline's* and not the line's, that a trailing `&&`
leaves `>` on the screen and not a prompt, and that
`echo before; exit 7; echo never` prints one of the two.

---

## The shell got variables

Second of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`. `$x`, `${x}`, the `${x-y}` family, the
specials, assignment as a word the parser knows, field splitting against `IFS`,
and `set`, `shift`, `unset`, `export` and `readonly`. `sh.wasm` went from 83,485
to 104,292 bytes and the staging tree from 552,965 to 588,594 against an
unchanged 1 MiB budget. **`kernel.wasm` did not move and the syscall ABI did not
change** — everything here is inside the process binary, and `smoke`'s exact
import and export surface stayed green untouched, which is what says so.

**`Field` needed a flag the mark could not carry.** The last stage put the
quoting mark out of band, one byte per byte, and that was right for everything
the mark will ever be asked — except one question it cannot be asked at all:
*was quoting the reason this field exists?* With x empty, `echo "$x"` must pass
one empty argument and `echo $x` must pass none, and both are a zero-length text
beside a zero-length mark. V7 spends its lone `QESC` on exactly this. So `Field`
gained a `bool quoted`, set by the `'` and `"` arms whether or not they
contribute a byte, and the splitter keeps an empty field only when it is set. It
was harmless while one field was always pushed; the moment a word could expand
to nothing it was the difference.

**Splitting happens during the walk, not after it.** We know whether a byte came
from an unquoted expansion at the moment we append it; after the fact we would
have to consult the mark to find out, and the mark would stop being scratch. So
the splitter is one branch in `put_value`, and a literal byte of the word never
goes through it — which is why `IFS=:` leaves the typed word `a:b` alone and
splits `$path` in two. That distinction is a `bool literal` threaded through the
walk, and it also settles `${x-a b}`: the body of an operator is expansion
output rather than the word's own bytes, so it splits, where the same two
characters typed directly would not.

**The expander took callbacks rather than calling the variable table.**
`var.cpp` is pure enough to have been linked into `tests.wasm` beside
`expand.cpp` and called directly, and that would have been less code. The seam
is there for the two stages that need it: command substitution adds a
`substitute` callback beside the lookup, and a function body will want a table
of its own that is not the shell's. Four function pointers now is the shape
those want, and the unit tests fill them with table literals — which is also
what keeps `expand.cpp` clear of every syscall, a fact the link into
`tests.wasm` enforces rather than promises.

**`x=1 cmd` sets, runs and restores — and a program cannot see it either way.**
There is no environment anywhere in the wasm ABI: `Sys::Spawn` hands a child
three descriptors, an argv and a cwd. So an assignment prefix on a program stage
is expanded and then has nowhere to go. Rather than leak it into the shell or
refuse the idiom, the prefix is applied around the one stage that can see it — a
builtin, and later `read`, `eval` and a function — and the displaced values are
put back after. `x=1` with no command word is the ordinary case and persists.
Per stage, so `x=1 a | y=2 b` leaks nothing.

**`${x?}` aborts the line rather than the shell.** V7 ends a non-interactive
shell there. Braam prints `braam: x: parameter not set` and reports 1 in both
modes, because script-entry policy belongs to the stage that adds `sh file` and
`sh -c` and there is nothing to be gained by deciding it early. Expansion runs
before anything is opened or spawned, so the line leaves nothing behind.

**A command may now have no command word at all**, which two things make
reachable: `x=1` alone, and a word that expands to nothing. `run_line` indexed
`args(i)[0]` unchecked at two sites, correct only because the parser guaranteed
a word and the expander guaranteed a field. Both guarantees are gone. The null
command performs its redirections, keeps its assignments and reports 0, which is
Bourne.

**`${` had to stop ending a word**, or `${x-a b}` would lex as two and
`${x-a|b}` as three. The lexer gained one arm, and it shares `brace_end` with
the expander rather than carrying a copy — unlike the quote arms, which are
duplicated because each needed a different thing from the same rule. `\$` also
became escapable inside double quotes, in both, which changes no word boundary
but makes `echo "\$x"` mean what it says.

**`/bin/export` became `save`.** The builtin and the program wanted one name,
and the builtin's is not negotiable — it is in every script ever written. The
program is the Blob download of Concept.md §5.4 and its name never was: `import`
and `save` are the pair now. The alternative was shipping no `export` builtin at
all, which is defensible only until §5.4's paragraph has to explain why a
standard name is missing.

**What the tests prove separately.** `test_expand.cpp` carries the whole `$`
grammar against a table-literal shell, including the empty quoted word against
the empty unquoted one, `"$@"` with no parameters leaving no field where `""`
leaves an empty one, and the mark showing that an unquoted expansion is
*unmarked* — which is what will let a `*` out of a variable glob at S4.
`test_parse.cpp` renders an assignment prefix in brackets, so `[x=1]{ls}` is one
string compare. `test/run.mjs` has what the unit suite cannot reach: that a
value set at the prompt survives to the next line, that `echo a "$e" b` and
`echo a $e b` differ by a space, and that `x=two echo hi` leaves the shell's x
where it was.

---

## The lexer stopped removing quotes

First of the stages in `src/sh/TODO.md`, which is the plan for making `/bin/sh`
a language rather than a prompt. Nothing a user can see changed: the grammar is
the same one line it was, and the same commands do the same things. What moved
is *when* quotes come off — out of `Lexer::next`, into a new `expand.cpp` that
runs between the parse and the run. `sh.wasm` went from 79,899 to 83,485 bytes,
and the staging tree from 549,379 to 552,965 against an unchanged 1 MiB budget.

**Two things force the move, and neither is a preference.** A loop body is
parsed once and expanded once per iteration, so `for f in *; do echo $f; done`
cannot have its words collapsed at parse time — there is nothing left to
re-expand. And `$` acts inside `"…"` and does not inside `'…'`, a distinction a
one-pass collapse throws away before anything can act on it. Both bite in the
stages after this one, which is exactly why this one is separate: it is the
whole refactor with none of the new behaviour, so a regression here is visible
on its own.

**`parse.h`'s comment was the thing that had to change.** It said words are
owned "because quote removal makes a word something the line does not contain" —
and with quotes left in, a word *is* a substring of the line again. The store
did not become unnecessary, but its justification did: it is now that a parse
outlives the text it came from, which is what a function body and a sourced file
will need. The old reason was true and would have quietly stopped being true.

**The lexer got smaller and stopped allocating.** It already walked the quotes
to find where a word ends; it merely also copied. Now it only walks, and
`next(Str &)` hands back a view. The double-quote arm keeps its escape rule
verbatim — only `\"` and `\\` — because that is not a copying detail but a
*scanning* one: without it a `\"` would close the run early and the word would
end in the wrong place.

**The quoting mark is a parallel byte array, and v7's encoding was rejected on
the reference's own argument.** The V7 shell marks a quoted character in bit
`0200` of the character, and the BESM-6 port had to move that to a `QESC` prefix
byte because its console is UTF-8. Braam's is too, and here it fails twice over:
there is no `int`-wide character space to hide a flag in either. So `Field`
carries `String text` plus a `Vec<u8> mark`, one byte per byte. Nothing reads it
yet — field splitting and globbing are the only two readers there will ever be,
and both are stages away — but it is built now because adding it later means
rewriting every branch of the expander. It is deliberately unconditional rather
than lazily allocated: an unused optimisation nobody has measured is worse than
an allocation nobody has measured.

**The expanded words are a second set, not a rewrite of the first.** `Run` grew
`words`, `argv`, `argv0` and `targets` beside the `Pipeline` it already held,
because one raw word may yield any number of fields and because the same tree
may be run more than once. `Run::args(i)` replaces `Pipeline::args(i)` at the
four sites that build a spawn, find a builtin or name one in a diagnostic. The
views are built only after the last append, which is `freeze()`'s rule one level
up — though the reason differs: a `Vec<Field>` moves its elements by stealing
their pointers, so the bytes never move and the discipline is habit rather than
necessity here. Habit is the point.

**What the tests now prove separately.** `test_tokenize.cpp` and
`test_parse.cpp` render words with their quotes still on and assert only where a
word *ends*; the quote-removal cases they lost are `test_expand.cpp`'s, along
with the mark, rendered as `^` and `.` per byte so one string compare checks
text and mark together. `expand.cpp` joins `parse.cpp` and `tokenize.cpp` in
`tests.wasm` — it touches nothing but `Str`, `String` and `Vec`, and the link is
what enforces that. Two cases went into `test/run.mjs` as well, because the unit
suite cannot prove the words reach a real `argv`: `echo 'a  b'` and
`echo a\ \ b`, both with **two** spaces, since one would survive the word
becoming two arguments and echo joining them back with a single space.

---

## Scrollback, and the renderer that was told nothing

`scroll()` memcpy'd the rows up and overwrote row 0, so everything that reached
the top of the window was gone. Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown now page back
over it, half a screen a press, the way the Linux console does. `kernel.wasm`
went from 146,326 to 148,483 bytes against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

**The history has to be the kernel's**, and that is the one thing not open to
argument. A row is overwritten inside a `tick`, often many of them, and
`host_present` fires once at the end — so by the time the page could look, the
row it would have kept is already gone. There is no capturing it from
`web/render.js` and no ABI that would let the page ask.

**The renderer, though, is told nothing at all.** `struct Screen` gained no
field, there is no new import or export, and `web/render.js` changed by one
comment. The kernel composes the view into a cell array and points `cells` at
it; the renderer paints row *i* at canvas row *i* as it always did. Selection
came free out of that: `all()`, `text()` and `bounds()` index `S_CELLS` freshly
on every call, so a drag over scrollback selects and copies scrollback without a
line of it knowing. The alternative — `view_top` and `history_cells` in the
descriptor, and `render.js` biasing its row reads — would have had to re-teach
the selection, `text()` and select-all what a row means, and would have put the
ring's layout into the ABI where the magic word is the only versioning there is.

**Which buffer moves is the whole design.** The obvious arrangement keeps
`cells` pinned and shadows the live screen while a view is up — and then every
write has to be kept from damaging a rectangle that is no longer on screen,
which means hooks in `damage`, `damage_all`, `screen_touch`, `screen_flush` and
`screen_cursor`, plus a private path for the view's own repaint to bypass them
all. Six edits to the hottest code in the kernel. Inverting it costs one:
`g_cells` stays the live screen, every writer is untouched, and `cells` points
at a composed block instead. A write while scrolled back damages a rectangle the
renderer then repaints out of the composed block, where those cells are
unchanged — wasted paint, never wrong pixels. What it costs is that the address
in the descriptor moves when a view opens or closes; nothing caches it, because
`memory.grow` detaching the buffer (§8.4) already forced everyone to re-derive,
but a test that holds a descriptor across a press is a hazard that did not exist
before, so `test/run.mjs` says so where it reads `cells`.

**The live screen stays live, which is what keeps the anchor arithmetic
honest.** Output goes on into the grid underneath, `screen_scrolled()` goes on
counting, and `LineEditor`'s anchor follows it — none of them can tell there is
a view. Freezing output instead would have meant deciding what `Sys::Echo`
should answer with, and the answer would have been a lie the moment the view
came down.

**Composing is the flush's, not the scroll's.** `scroll()` runs once per output
line. Recomposing there would memcpy the whole grid that often — a megabyte a
line at the widest geometry, thousands of times inside one `tick`, which is a
hang rather than a slowdown. It sets a flag instead, and `screen_flush` composes
once a tick, where `host_present` already is.

**The view stays on the rows being read.** When output scrolls the grid
underneath, the offset grows with it, so the text does not slide. Once the ring
is full the oldest row is evicted and the offset clamps instead, and from there
the view drifts by a row per scroll — correct, since those rows are genuinely
gone, but the kind of thing someone later reads as a bug, so it is asserted.

**Any key comes home, and that is a choice.** The Linux console leaves you where
you are until you page back down. Coming home on the next keystroke is the more
forgiving rule, and it also makes the prompt provably live whenever anything is
typed — so the line editor's anchor can never be pointing into a view, and there
is no interaction to reason about. Paging is therefore the only chord that does
not come home, and `MOD_SHIFT` was free: nothing in the kernel had ever looked
at it.

**The pump owns the chord, but not while a program holds the screen.** `less`
and `edit` page with PageUp and switch on the code alone, and the grid they are
painting is not the one with the history behind it — so the claim gates the
interception, and an unshifted PageUp was never the pump's anyway. `FullScreen`
brings the view home before it snapshots, and that is load-bearing rather than
tidy: `less /README &` claims the screen from a syscall with no keystroke in
between, and without it the renderer would sit on a frozen view while the pager
painted underneath.

**512 rows, allocated on the first scroll.** A row is `cols * 8` bytes, so it is
320 KB at eighty columns and 2 MiB at the widest grid the host can ask for; a
screen that never fills pays nothing, and a heap that will not give it up means
no scrollback rather than no screen. A width change re-widths the ring, clipping
and padding each row exactly as the grid itself is clipped and padded — there is
no line model to re-wrap with, which is the same reason resize has never had
one. Only on a width change: `web/worker.js` calls `resize()` on every viewport
event, and a rows-only change must not copy megabytes per frame.

**`clear` does not clear it**, the way the Linux console does not. The screen
blanks and what scrolled off it is still there to page back to.

**Re-wrapping logical lines is still outstanding.** §3.5 promised it would "land
with whichever milestone needs scrollback"; scrollback landed without it,
because the per-row continuation bit is a property of how a row was *written*,
and history stores rows that were already written. The promise moves rather than
being kept — and the selection that dies on the next keystroke is still waiting
on the same bit.

## /mnt/import became /import

The picker's landing directory sat under a `/mnt` that never held anything else.
`/mnt` is where Unix puts *mounted* filesystems, and §5.1's whole point is that
there is one store and one generated tree: `/bin`, `/share`, `/home`, `/tmp` and
the import directory are all directories in the same `OpfsFs`. A `/mnt` with a
single ordinary directory under it promised a second filesystem the system has
no way to give, and cost every user of the escape hatch four extra characters on
a path they type by hand. `/import` says what it is at the root, beside the
rest.

It is a rename with no mechanism behind it: `make_dirs` in `src/user/boot.cpp`
creates one directory instead of two, `import`'s default destination is
`/import`, and the archive still carries neither — `installOps` names only the
top-level directories `rootfs.zip` actually contains, so the tree it does not
carry is still never touched.

**An existing store keeps its old `/mnt/import`, files and all.** Boot does not
migrate it and nothing removes it, because a boot-time rename would have to
decide what to do about a collision with a `/import` already made and would run
on every boot for ever after. `mv /mnt/import/* /import` then `rm -r /mnt` is
the whole of it, and a store that is never touched simply carries a stale
directory — which is what §5.2 means by the archive, not the store, being what
the system recovers from.

## ls asks whether it is talking to a terminal

`ls` printed one name per line, always, and understood one flag. Bringing BSD's
`ls` across — `-C` in columns, `-R`, `-S`, `-r`, `-d`, `-h`, a `-l` that lines
up — turned out to need one thing the system did not have, and the rest fell out
of it.

**There is no `isatty`, and §2.3 is why.** The terminal is a cell grid, not a
byte stream, so there is no escape sequence a program could send and no
environment it could read a width out of. `Sys::Cursor` reports the grid's
geometry, but it reports it to a program whose stdout is a pipe just as readily,
so it cannot answer the question that matters. The kernel *can* answer it:
`stdio_console()` installs one sink and `pipe_sink`/`file_sink` install others,
and that function pointer is the whole of the difference. It was simply never
reported. `Sys::Tty` is the operation that reports it — the thirty-seventh, arg
= fd, data = a flags word and the geometry.

Three choices inside it are worth the ink:

- **An explicit predicate in `tty.h`, not `ctx == nullptr` in the dispatcher.**
  The console sink is today the only `Stream` with a null context, so the
  implicit test would work. It would also silently promote the next sink that
  happens to need no context into a terminal. `tty_is_console` says what is
  meant, in the file that owns the fact; `console_is_input` is its twin for fd
  0, so `arg = fd` is honest across its whole domain rather than over two thirds
  of it.
- **Zero geometry for a pipe, not 80.** A caller cannot distinguish an invented
  width from a measured one, and would believe it. The fallback belongs in the
  program, where it is visible: `ls -C` into a pipe formats at eighty because
  `ls` chose eighty.
- **A flags word rather than a bool.** It is what `SYS_STORE_*` bought `Storage`
  — room for a second fact about a terminal without a thirty-eighth operation.

`PROC_ABI` went 8 → 9. The change is purely additive and an old binary would
never call the new opcode, so nothing would actually break; the bump is the
tree's standing rule that the number tracks the table, and it buys a sentence at
exec (`built for another process ABI`) instead of a stale binary meeting
`Err(Unsupported)` somewhere further in. In-tree it costs a rebuild, since
`tools/stamp.py` reads the constant.

**The flag parser is a third header in `src/proc/`, and a translation unit of
its own.** `ls` went from one flag to eight, and every command in `src/cmd/` was
hand-rolling a leading-flag loop that did not accept `-lR`. `proc/opt.h` is not
part of `io.h`, which is one wrapper per syscall, nor of `rt.h`, which is
`_start` and `SysCall`. Being its own `.cpp` is load-bearing: `--gc-sections`
never extracts an unreferenced archive member, so the thirty-three binaries that
do not call it pay nothing — the rule the builtin table exists for, used the
other way round. `ls` is the only adopter here; `head` and `tail` would take
`Opts{"", "n"}` unchanged, and were left alone.

**Column-major, and a shared column width.** A sorted listing is read *down* a
column: filling across would put `ls` and `mkdir` in different columns of the
same row and make the sort useless to the eye. The width is one number for the
whole block, as BSD's is rather than GNU's per-column fitting — with a `total`
in 512-byte blocks under `-l`, `FS_BLOCK` being the system's own unit. The last
cell of a row is deliberately not padded: trailing blanks would leave the cursor
in the deferred-wrap column, and the test harness trims them, so that bug would
have passed the suite and shown up only in a browser.

**Width is codepoints, not bytes.** `screen_write` puts one codepoint in one
cell, so `Buf::put_left`/`put_right` — which pad by `Str::size()` — cannot be
used on a filename at all; `ls` counts with `utf8_decode` and pads a `String`
itself. They are still right for the `-l` size column, which is ASCII digits.

**`-R` is an explicit stack, not a recursive coroutine.** §8.2 prices a
coroutine frame at a whole size class, and a frame per directory level is the
wrong shape for a tree. One heap `Vec<String>` holds what is still to list;
children are pushed in reverse of the order they printed, so they pop in it,
which is BSD's depth-first pre-order for free. Memory is bounded by sibling
counts along the current path rather than by the tree, and there are no cycles
to guard against: symbolic links arrived afterwards and a listing reports one as
`SYS_KIND_LINK` rather than as what it points at, so `-R` — which pushes on
`SYS_KIND_DIR` alone — still cannot walk through one. The entry vector, that
stack, the operand list and the row buffer are one heap block for §8.2's
reason, the same
one `less` has a `Pager` for.

**What could not be brought across at all**: `-t`, `-i`, `-s`, `-o`, `-T` and
`-L`. The filesystem stores `{kind, size}` and nothing else — no mtime, mode,
owner, link count or inode anywhere in `Stat`, `Entry` or the `Sys::List` wire
format. Any of those is a change reaching both storage backends and the ABI, not
a change to `ls`. (`-t` since arrived, by making exactly that change — see
"Files have a modification time", above. `-L` has since become *answerable*, and
is still not there: with links in the system it would mean "follow them", and
what `-l` does instead is decline to follow an *operand*, which is the case
worth having. The other four stand.) `-a`/`-A` were left out for a different
reason: nothing in the tree creates a dotfile and nothing hides one, so the flag
would introduce the concept of a hidden file rather than expose it. `-F` is
already there and unconditional — the trailing slash on a directory is the only
thing distinguishing it from a file in the short form, and under columns it
earns its place twice over.

**vmstat's rate columns went from five wide to six.** `W_RATE = 5` gave a
five-digit rate no separator from the column on its left, so `sy` and `cs` ran
together into one number. The listing work tipped `cs` over 10,000 and exposed
it; the row is 74 columns now and still inside eighty.

The layout tests moved off `/bin` and onto a `/home/t` the suite builds itself.
A listing of `/bin` is a test that fails whenever a program is added, which
makes it a test of the wrong thing; what is left pointing at `/bin` asks only
that `cd` is absent and `timeout` present.

`ls` costs 26,504 bytes against 15,633, and the staged tree 549,403 against
538,499 — 52% of its budget. `kernel.wasm` grew 318 bytes for the new arm, to
146,342. Every `ls` now pays one extra round trip for `Sys::Tty`, 34–45 µs;
against it, a directory listing to the grid is one write per *row* rather than
one per entry, which on `/bin` is six writes instead of thirty-four.

## exec.cpp was four things in one file

At 2,211 lines it was a 3.4× outlier over the next largest source in the tree
and more than half of `src/user/`, and the reason it could not shrink was
structural: everything in it sat in one anonymous namespace, so nothing could
leave without first becoming a name another translation unit can see.
`src/user/proctab.h` is that step — the process record, the descriptor behind a
number, the parked call, and the counted references over all three. It is
private to the directory in the only way this tree has ever made a header
private: it is not installed, and it says at the top that `exec.cpp`,
`syscall.cpp` and `proctab.cpp` are the whole of its audience. `exec.h` remains
the surface for everyone else, which is why `boot.cpp`, `procfs.cpp` and
`main.cpp` did not change a line.

The cut is by *what the code is doing*, not by size. `exec.cpp` keeps the life
of a process — resolving a name, waiting for a worker, stepping the instance,
and the four entry points the kernel exports. `syscall.cpp` keeps what a process
asks for: `proc_syscall` and the child a `Sys::Spawn` creates, since `Spawned`
exists only because that operation does. `proctab.cpp` keeps the table and its
accessors, and `exec_proc_state` with them — `/proc`'s view of a process is a
query over that table and nothing else, which is what lets `g_procs` stay a
file-local of the one file that owns it.

**The syscall switch stayed one file.** The `Sys` enum blocks the ABI into
families and the switch follows it, so cutting it four more ways along those
lines was the obvious next move and was decided against: a family would then be
a coroutine of its own, and a coroutine is a frame per outstanding call. The
read of §8.2 that matters here is that a frame past 512 bytes costs a whole 64
KiB span, and the dispatcher's frame is already the union of every arm's live
state — splitting it would have added a second frame to that, not replaced it.
One file of 1,320 lines with four visible sections is the cheaper shape.

**The helper set stops where the frame does.** `CO_CALL` (a Task that would not
allocate is `Err(NoMemory)`, not a crash) and `CO_RETRY` (an `Again` is a stray
wake) are macros for exactly that reason: a function wrapping an `await` is a
coroutine, and these had to stay inline. What is left is plain functions —
`chunk_reply` and `write_status` for the tails a read and a write share,
`handle_bind` for the five arms that open something, `reply_u32` for the twelve
that answered with a fixed header. Nothing was factored that had fewer than
three callers.

**Cancellation folded to one exit.** The switch had twenty-six
`co_return Err(Cancelled)` between its arms, each an early return out of a
coroutine and each carrying its own unwind. They are now a single check after
the switch: `-Error::Cancelled` in `status` means the reply is abandoned,
wherever in the switch it was set. That is the same semantics — no arm ever
reported cancellation *to* the program — and it is where the size went: 147,182
bytes before the split, 146,024 after, against a budget of 262,144. A refactor
that was supposed to cost a little returned a kilobyte.

Two out-of-memory paths were wrong and are fixed in passing, both the same
mistake. `Sys::Fetch` bound its handle into the descriptor table and *then*
released it if copying the headers failed, leaving the table pointing at a freed
block; the release now happens before the bind. `handle_bind` exists so that the
other four arms cannot make the same mistake: it binds, or it closes what it was
given and reports `-NoMemory`, and there is no order left for a caller to get
wrong.

## The tree that becomes the root is called rootfs

`bundle/` is now `rootfs/`, and the staging copy `build/bundle/` is
`build/rootfs/`. The name was the last survivor of `bundle.bin`, the packed blob
that `rootfs.zip` replaced: since then the directory, the staging tree, the size
budget's entry and the archive the host fetches were one thing under two names,
and the one nobody sees on disk was the one the code used. The budget line reads
`rootfs/` and the archive beside it `rootfs.zip`, which is the point — the tree
and the file are the same content, compressed or not.

`/bin/version` went at the same time. It printed `BRAAM_VERSION` and nothing
else, which the boot banner, `/proc/version` and `uname -a` each already say; a
whole binary, its worker and its instantiation for a string the kernel prints
unasked. It was also the only program that included `kernel/version.h`, so the
`revision` dependency the build named one target at a time lost an entry rather
than gaining a rule.

---

## What the kernel is doing, as rates

`ps` says what each task *is*. Nothing said what the system was *doing*. Every
counter the kernel kept was a running total on `/proc/meminfo` — `allocs` and
`frees` — and nobody subtracted them, so the figure §8.2 calls the primary
workload of the whole system was invisible as a rate. The costs §4.4 quantifies
were in the same position: two `postMessage` hops per syscall, one syscall per
512-byte chunk, asserted in prose and impossible to watch. `vmstat 1000` during
`cat big | wc -c` is the first thing that shows them.

**One file, because a row is one moment.** The counters could have been columns
added to `/proc/meminfo` and gauges added to `/proc/tasks`, and then a row would
have been two `open`s and two moments — which is exactly the mistake
`/proc/tasks` was introduced to avoid. `/proc/stat` therefore repeats the heap's
figures rather than referring to them, the same duplication `/proc/tasks` has
against `/proc/<pid>`, and for the same reason. Both branches call
`heap_stats()` once so neither can drift.

**`now` is the first line, and it is the whole design.** It is the `sched_now()`
the counters below it were incremented against, so the reader divides by the
file's own elapsed time rather than by how long it asked to sleep. A throttled
background tab, a late timer and a `^C`-shortened sleep all come out right, and
the interval argument degrades to a fallback divisor for the case — reachable,
since the clock is truncated to whole milliseconds — where two reads land inside
the same millisecond. It also makes the since-boot first row fall out for free:
`counter / now` is BSD's `rate()` over `getuptime()`, with no special case.

**A woken token is two different events and is counted as two.** `sched_wake`
has four callers and only one of them is the host: a channel wakes its peer, and
an exiting child wakes a parked parent. Counting them in one column would have
put every byte moved through a pipe in the same figure as an answer from
outside, so `wc a | grep b` would have read as an interrupt storm.
`Waiter::parked` — the flag `/proc` already uses to tell a `park` from a `host`
wait — splits them into `wakes` and `unparks`, which costs one branch. `unparks`
is a number nothing else in the system exposes: pipe traffic has never been
observable.

**`frames` is exact rather than a share of `allocs`.** A `Task`'s promise
declares `get_return_object_on_allocation_failure`, so its frame is allocated
through the nothrow `operator new` and nothing else in the tree reaches that
overload. One increment there is precisely the coroutine-frame count, which is
the number §8.2 is about; `allocs` mixes it with every string and every heap
record. `fails` is on the same principle: every error in the system funnels into
`Err(NoMemory)` and this is the only place the count becomes visible.

**`ready` is a task suspended on nothing, not the depth of the ready queue.**
The tempting definition, `ready.size() - head`, is wrong here for a reason that
is easy to miss: `/proc/stat` is generated inside `open`, inside a syscall
server, inside the drain loop, so that figure would measure whatever happened to
be queued behind the reader in one drain — and would exclude the reader. The
definition used is the one `/proc/tasks` already prints as state, which makes
`ready + on_timer + on_host + on_park == tasks` an invariant a test can assert,
and makes `r` mean what `ps` prints as `R`. The consequence is that `vmstat` is
always in its own row — `r` and `p` are never zero while it is the one asking,
since its syscall server is runnable and its stepper is parked on the reply. BSD
subtracted itself out (`total.t_rq - 1`); that would be wrong here, because
`cat /proc/stat` reads the same file and is not the same shape.

**Counters live in `Sched`, gauges are computed there.** A file-static would
survive `sched_reset()` and accumulate across the fixed-order unit suite; a
member of the object the reset destroys is zeroed with it, which is what a test
starting from a clean scheduler means. The heap's counters are the other way
round — `heap_init` runs once — so `/proc/stat` mixes two zero points. That is
invisible in a running system, which has one `Sched` lifetime, and only shows up
in the test suite.

**No CPU column, and the group that replaced it says so.** Kernel-busy
milliseconds are measurable with two `host_now()` calls around the tick drain,
and were rejected: in a browser tab the answer is zero almost always, and as a
percentage of wall time it would read 99–100% idle — a column bought with a
hot-path cost that says nothing, and a label reading `cpu` would read as
retiring a documented gap (§4.2). `-loop-` is in its place: how often the host
granted the event loop a turn, which does vary, and collapses when the tab is
backgrounded. `-alloc-` similarly stands where BSD's `-page-` was, there being
no paging; allocations are this system's page faults.

**Seconds, which makes it the one time argument here that is not milliseconds.**
`sleep`, `watch -n` and `timeout` all take milliseconds, and consistency with
them was the first choice; BSD's units are the better one. The columns are rates
*per second*, so the interval that divides them wants the same unit, and
`vmstat 1` has to mean the useful thing rather than an interval that would
measure almost nothing but vmstat itself. Memory is in raw KB rather than `ps`'s
scaled units for a related reason: a `vmstat` column is scanned downwards, and a
unit that changes between rows defeats the only thing that makes scanning it
worth doing. BSD's `pgtok` does the same.

**What is deliberately absent.** `-i` would need every wake token tagged with a
source, and a token is opaque on purpose. `-m` is the interesting one —
`domem()` prints kernel malloc by bucket size and the allocator has exactly that
shape, `SIZE_CLASS[]` plus whole-span blocks — but it needs per-class counters
in the allocator's hot path, and it is a separate argument to make. `bi`/`bo`
were dropped because `sy` already exposes that traffic: bulk I/O is one syscall
per `SYS_CHUNK`. `-f`, `-t`, `-M` and `-N` have nothing to report: no fork, no
page-in timing, no core file, no namelist.

**The file is emitted a line at a time, and that is not a style choice.** `Buf`
truncates silently and `overflowed()` is called nowhere in the tree, so a single
buffer for twenty-three lines would have been a latent bug that returned the
moment someone added a counter — and because `stat` and `read` both work off the
same snapshot, they would have agreed on the short answer and no reader could
have told. A per-line `Buf<32>` holds the worst case, eight padded characters
and a space and twenty digits and a newline, and makes the file's total length
unbounded. The counter table is then the one place a counter is added, which is
also why `vmstat -s` prints an unknown name under itself rather than needing an
edit.

**`vmstat` measures itself**, about four syscalls per row: noise at a one-second
interval, and most of the reading at 100 ms. BSD has the same property and does
not correct for it either.

One test needed narrowing rather than fixing: `ls /bin | grep ta` asserted the
match was exactly `tail`, and `vmstat` contains `ta`. It is `grep tai` now.

## MEM is measured, and it rides back on the step

`ps` reported the memory *cap*, and every row read `16M` — one number, the same
for every process, which is a column that costs eleven characters and says
nothing. It reports what the instance has actually committed now.

The figure exists after all. The section below is right that nothing will report
a **worker's** memory — that needs `measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()` and
therefore COOP/COEP — but a process is not only a worker: it is a
`WebAssembly.Memory`, and a Memory says its own size. `buffer.byteLength` is the
pages the instance has grown to, read off the object rather than measured, and
it is exactly the RSS analogue `ps` wanted. Only the worker holds it, so only
the worker can read it — which is why `Memory.pages()` is in `web/host.js`
beside the other accessor that has to re-derive after a `grow`.

**It comes back on the step, not on an operation of its own.** A new `SvcOp` was
the obvious shape and is the wrong one twice over: `/proc` is generated at
`open` with nothing to await (§5.1), so an asynchronous query could not have fed
the file it exists for; and a step already carries a message each way.
`result_hi` in the reply record was unused by `ProcStep`, so the pages travel
there and `proc_step` takes a `u32 *pages` out-param the way `exec_process`
takes `bool *died`. No new operation, no extra round trip, and nothing at all on
the hot path — the kernel reads the field it is already being handed.

So the figure is as of the process's last step, and that is the most current one
there can be: a process grows its memory only while it runs, and it runs only
during a step. A process that has not finished its first step reports
`ProcMeta.initial_pages`, which is what the host sized the Memory to — the truth
then, rather than nought.

`/proc/<pid>` carries both, `mem` and `cap`, since a per-process ceiling is
worth having somewhere even when it is uniform; `/proc/tasks` carries both as
fields and `ps` prints only the first. The column scales like `df`'s, one
decimal below ten, because the numbers now vary: the shell reads `1.2M` and
`cat` `448K` where the cap column only ever said `16M` for both. `ps` asserts in
the suite that what init holds is neither nought nor the whole cap, which is
what proves a host figure arrived rather than a placeholder.

So the shell holds 1,310,720 bytes of its 16 MB and `cat` 458,752, and the
ceiling was never the thing worth watching — the difference between two programs
is.

## ps, and what a browser will say about a worker

The question that started this was whether the browser lets us look inside a
worker, so that `ps` could report what each one is doing. It does not, and the
answer is worth writing down because it looks like an oversight and is not one:

- There is no enumeration. No `navigator.workers`, no registry, no parent-side
  list. The only handle to a worker is the `Worker` object that created it,
  which is why `web/proc.js` keeps `procs` and `idle` itself.
- The handle is opaque: `postMessage`, `terminate`, `onmessage`, `onerror`. No
  id, no state, no start time, no exit code. `onerror` is the only involuntary
  signal, which is why `broke()` has to synthesise `STEP.TRAPPED`.
- There is no per-worker CPU time anywhere in the platform.
- The one memory API, `performance.measureUserAgentSpecificMemory()`, requires
  `crossOriginIsolated` — the COOP/COEP headers this system deliberately does
  without (§C.3), so that it hosts anywhere. Even where it is available it
  reports an agent-cluster breakdown, not a worker. `performance.memory` is
  non-standard and main-thread only.

DevTools sees workers through the CDP, which is not reachable from a page. So
*nothing* a browser offers would have helped, and none of it was needed: **the
kernel already keeps a better table than the platform could have given us.** A
worker is exactly a process, so "does this task hold a worker" is
`proc_find(pid)` succeeding, and `ps` costs no host round trip, no new import
and no ABI change at all.

### /proc/tasks, because a row per read describes a row per moment

`ps` reads one file. The alternative — list `/proc` and read `/proc/<pid>` per
row — costs two `postMessage` hops per syscall *and* breaks the rule the same
§5.1 paragraph states: content is produced at `open` so that a read cannot
describe two moments. Twelve rows read one at a time are twelve snapshots.
`/proc/tasks` is generated in a single pass, so the table is coherent.

Its fields are positional like `/proc/mounts`, with the cwd last so nothing
after it needs finding: a path may hold a space, and the shell does quote. A
name may too, so a space in one becomes an underscore — a name is a display
field, and the alternative was a quoting rule in a file two programs parse.

`/proc/<pid>` grew the same facts as named lines and its value column widened
from six to seven to fit `worker`. That is a visible change to a file people
`cat`, and the cheaper alternative was a cryptic four-letter name for the one
fact `ps` puts at the centre of its table.

### The columns, and the two that are honest about what they cannot say

`PID PPID NAME STAT WORKER WAIT CALLS FDS MEM ELAPSED CWD`. STAT is BSD's: a
state letter — `R` ready, `S` waiting, `C` cancelled — then `+` for the
foreground and `k`/`s` for the console claims. So STAT says whether a task is
suspended and WAIT says on what, with no redundancy.

**MEM started as the cap, not the usage** — `ProcMeta.max_pages`, which
`spawn_process` had been computing and discarding — on the reasoning that no
browser API reports what a worker holds. That is true of a *worker* and not of
an instance, and the section below corrects it: MEM is the measured figure now.
**There is no CPU column**: nothing meters one, and a runaway program is killed
rather than measured.

### WAIT needed a bit in the Waiter, because a token cannot say what it is for

WAIT was to come free from the queue an awaiter registers in — the timer queue
or the wake table. It does not. `Channel` parks with `sched_wait_token` and so
does a host call, and the stdio path parks a token of its own through
`park_receiver`. Every blocked task read `host`, including a stage blocked on a
pipe, which is the one distinction the column exists to draw: is this pipeline
waiting for data, or is the host wedged?

So the awaiter says so. `Waiter::parked` is set by `Channel`'s two awaiters and
by `Stream::Write` and `Source::Read`, where a non-null `park_` *is* the fact
that this is a channel. Four bytes per suspended frame against a column that
would otherwise have lied. A `sleep 5000 | wc` now reads `timer` for the
sleeper's server and `park` for the one blocked on the pipe.

### A syscall server is a task, and names the process it serves

Every outstanding syscall is its own scheduler job (§4.3), so they appear in
`ps` — a process named `wc` beside its server named `/bin/wc`. Left alone they
look like orphans, so `exec_proc_state` searches the `Call` records for one
whose `server` is this pid and reports its owner as PPID. It holds only while
the call is outstanding: once answered, the record is erased and what is left is
a coroutine finishing, which is what `/proc` then says about it. Recording the
owner on the job instead would have contradicted §3.3 — a job is a task, a name
and a `CancelToken`, and that is all the scheduler keeps.

`ps` is wide, so the suite widens the grid for it the way it already does for
`help`.

---

## df is a table

`df` printed a four-line key/value block — `backend`, `mode`, `quota`, `used` —
and then one prose line per mount. Every fact §5.3 asked for was in it and none
of it looked like `df`. It is the BSD table now:

```
Filesystem  1K-blocks     Used    Avail Capacity  Mounted on
opfs         10485760      487 10485273     0%    /
procfs              0        0        0      -    /proc
```

**Nothing was added to the ABI, because nothing had to be.** The two sources
`df` already used carry the whole table: `/proc/mounts` names each mount and its
filesystem, and `Sys::Storage` answers with the live quota and usage. A
per-mount `statfs` operation was the obvious shape and is the wrong one — there
is one store behind every writable mount, so the syscall would return the same
pair however many times it was asked, and Concept.md §4.3's table would have
grown an operation to say so. What the row needs from the kernel is which mount
is backed by the store, and the `kind` field has been saying that since M5.

So a mount whose kind is `opfs` reports the origin's figures, and two of them
would report the same ones. That is not a fudge: they *are* one store, and BSD
shows one device mounted twice the same way. Anything else answers from
`Fs::bytes()`, which is still declared and still unimplemented — `/proc` holds
no bytes and says `0 0 0 -`, which is the honest row rather than a missing one.

**The mode moved to the boot banner, and that amends a criterion.** M5's second
was "`df` reports quota, usage, and persistent versus best-effort mode". The
quota and the usage are the table. Durability is not a per-mount fact and had
nowhere to sit in one: it belongs to the origin, beside the quota, on the
`store:` line boot already prints. The backend went with it for a simpler reason
— `boot_filesystem` refuses to start without OPFS and sync handles, so
`backend opfs` was a line that could never read anything else.

The cost is real and is accepted rather than worked around. `persisted` is not
settled when boot reads it: the page sends a provisional best-effort answer
after a 250 ms grace period and the real one when the browser decides, and the
late one corrects `OpfsStore.persisted` in JS. `df` asking again was what made
that correction visible; a banner line is a snapshot, so a store that becomes
persistent a second after boot goes on saying `best-effort` until the next
reload. Putting the mode back in `df` to recover that would put a column in the
table that is the same in every row, which is the thing the table was written to
stop.

**`-h`, because the number is gigabytes.** `10485760` is not a figure anyone
reads; `10G` is. The scaling is a dozen lines in `df.cpp` rather than anything
shared — `text.h` has no formatter and nothing else wants one. It keeps a
decimal only below ten, so three significant digits carry the magnitude: `9.9G`,
`487K`, `0B`.

**Alignment is `Buf`'s now.** Nothing in the tree could right-justify a number:
`ls` does not align at all, `date` hand-rolls a two-digit pad, `/proc` pads its
keys with literal spaces in the string. `put_left`, `put_right(Str)` and
`put_right(u64)` are three members on `Buf`, which is a template — the kernel
links none of them. A value wider than its column is written whole and pushes
the rest of the row, because a truncated size is worse than a ragged line.

The widths are BSD's exactly, including the quirk where the capacity column's
header ends two places past its values. That puts the whole row inside sixty
columns, which matters here more than it does on a terminal: the test grid is
sixty wide and wrapping would have made every assertion a two-line one.

## The banner names the host, not the heap

The boot line read
`braam 0.2.65-6e62a37 — heap at 0x00030000, 64 KiB, 1 allocs, up in 200 us`.
Three of its four facts were allocator internals that `/proc/meminfo` already
reports in more detail, printed at the one moment nobody is asking about the
allocator. What was missing is the thing a browser makes genuinely hard to know:
what the system is running *on*. Nothing in `web/` read `navigator.userAgent`,
`hardwareConcurrency`, `deviceMemory` or `userAgentData` at all.

Now the version line carries the version and the boot time, and a block under it
names the browser, the OS, the architecture, the cores, the memory and the
store. The same facts are `/proc/host`, and `uname` reformats that file the way
`mount` reformats `/proc/mounts`.

The grid's own geometry is in `/proc/host` and not in the banner: it is a fact
about the screen it would be printed on, so it is the one line a reader can
already see the answer to. `/proc/host` reads it fresh on every open, which is
what makes it worth having there — it moves with the window, and a boot-time
number would be wrong by the first resize.

**Two constraints decided the shape, and neither was negotiable.** `init()` is a
synchronous export, so nothing in it can `co_await` a service — and it runs
before the host's first `resize()`, so `screen().cols` there is always the
placeholder 80. And `/proc` is generated synchronously: `generate()` returns
`bool` and `stat`/`list`/`open` all call it without awaiting, so a `/proc/host`
that asked the host on every read was never possible. Both point one way: ask
once from the boot coroutine, which runs on the first tick with the real
geometry in place, and keep the answer. A cache is not a compromise here — a
browser does not change under a running tab. The storage figures cost nothing
extra either, because `boot_filesystem` already awaits `storage_info()` as its
first act and has the quota in hand.

**What a browser will not tell you.** There is no `navigator.cpu`. A CPU model
and a clock rate do not exist in any browser API, and the two ways of faking
them were both refused: a microbenchmark measures the JIT and the coarsened
timer as much as the silicon, and the WebGL renderer string names a GPU, not a
processor. They are omitted. Cores come from `hardwareConcurrency`, which is
everywhere; architecture, OS version and full browser version come from
`userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues()`, which is Chromium's alone.

**No user-agent parsing, deliberately.** It would have filled the gap on Safari
and Firefox, and it would have lied: Safari's UA still says
`Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7` on Apple Silicon. A field nothing can answer is left
out, and the raw agent string is shown instead of an interpretation of it. That
is the whole reason the wire format has a blank line in the middle — above it is
what is short enough and useful enough for the boot grid, below it the locale
and the agent string, which wraps a row on its own and only carries information
when the interpreted fields are absent. Boot writes the half above; `/proc/host`
serves all of it. It also means the kernel never parses a field:
`next_line`/`next_field` live in `src/proc/io.h`, the process runtime, which the
kernel cannot reach — so the split is a single scan for `"\n\n"` rather than a
parser in `boot.cpp`.

**Two things `userAgentData` gets wrong if taken literally.** Chrome's `brands`
lists both `Chromium` and `Google Chrome`, and varies the order on purpose to
break sniffers — so taking the first non-GREASE entry names a different browser
on different loads. The specific brand is the one worth printing, so `Chromium`
is chosen only when nothing else is there. And Windows reports a
`platformVersion` that is not a Windows version: Windows 11 says `15.0.0`. That
mapping is published rather than inferred, so it is applied; UA-CH answers `0`
for 7, 8 and 8.1 without distinguishing them, and those get no number at all
rather than a wrong one.

**The formatting is the host's.** `describeHost()` in `web/svc.js` returns
finished `name value` lines, the value at column 9. The colon the boot banner
shows is added as it writes, by `write_labelled` in `boot.cpp`: it is
presentation, and putting it in the stored text would make `/proc/host` a worse
table — `uname` reads a field out of that file with `next_field`, and the name
would carry punctuation. It is also why `timezone`, the one name that fills the
column, gets its separating space from the writer rather than from the padding.
Which fields exist varies by browser, so composing them in the kernel would have
meant teaching it about `userAgentData`; this way `kernel.wasm` grew by the
price of one service wrapper. `HostInfo` sits with the other services rather
than after the process operations, which renumbered `PROC_SPAWN`/`STEP`/`KILL` —
safe because only `web/svc.js` writes those numbers down, the C++ side using
enum names and `test/fakesvc.mjs` importing the table.

**`uname -a` prints the block rather than one packed line.** There is no POSIX
contract here, and four fields is not what is worth reading about a browser.
`-s`, `-r` and `-m` are the classic three, and `-m` is `wasm32` — the one fact
neither the host nor the version supplies.

Storage stayed out of `/proc/host`. Quota and usage are live, `df` exists to ask
for them, and a cached copy would go stale. The banner names the quota alone for
the same reason: the usage is the half that moves, so a figure true only at boot
is the wrong one to leave on the screen all session, while how much room the
origin gave is a fact about the machine like the others around it.

The banner block costs three rows of the grid. On the 60×16 screen
`test/run.mjs` resizes to, boot occupies 13 rows of 16 — which is why the fake's
host string in `test/fakesvc.mjs` is two short lines, and why the motd is seven.
A longer one would push the greeting off the top, and the motd assertion is what
would catch it.

## One store, and rootfs.zip

Three filesystems held the namespace: `MemFs` for `/`, `BundleFs` for a
read-only `/bin` and `/share` unpacked from a fetched archive in linear memory,
`OpfsFs` for `/home`. Only `/home` survived a reload, every boot downloaded 491
KB whether or not anything had changed, and the files a user made outside
`/home` — in `/tmp`, in `/mnt/import` — quietly did not exist after one. Now `/`
is one `OpfsFs` and everything else is a directory in it. `kernel.wasm` lost 10
KB with the other two filesystems, but that is not why: three stores meant three
answers to every question about durability, and users only ever wanted one.

**Nothing above the VFS had to change.** `exec_resolve` reads a program image
with `read_file` and boot builds its directories with `vfs_mkdir`, so which
backend a path lands in was never visible from userland. That is the property
the mount layering was built for, and this is the first change that spent it.

**The unpacker moved to JS, and the format became a zip.** `BBND` existed
because a kernel had to parse it: 231 lines of `bundlefs.cpp` reading a table of
offsets into a blob it kept in linear memory, with a matching writer in
`tools/pack.py`. Once the archive is written into OPFS rather than mounted, the
only thing that reads it is `web/fs.js` — and there the browser's own
`DecompressionStream` and Python's `zipfile` do the work, so the hand-rolled
format bought nothing and cost two implementations to keep in step. `rootfs.zip`
is inspectable with `unzip -l`, buildable by hand, and 204 KB where `bundle.bin`
was 491 KB.

Deflating it moved what the size budget means. That entry exists so §4.4's
per-binary duplication "shows in one number", and a compressor hides precisely
that — so `size_budget.py` grew a directory branch and the budget now names the
*staging tree*, at the number `bundle.bin` used to report. The download got
smaller as a side effect rather than as a way of not looking at the total.

**The fetch is lazy, and the stamp is what makes it so.** The host writes
`/version` as the last step of an unpack, with the string the kernel passed —
its own `BRAAM_VERSION`, so the stamp cannot disagree with the kernel that asked
for it. Boot compares, and a match means the archive is never requested: the
steady state costs no download at all. Written last, so an interrupted unpack
leaves a stamp that does not match and is done again rather than believed.

A mismatch asks. The alternative was overwriting on sight, which is what a
service worker would do, but a stored `/bin` is the user's — they may have put
something there — and the prompt costs one line above a prompt they were about
to see anyway. Declining boots on what is stored; if those binaries are stale,
`exec_resolve` already says so by name ("built for another process ABI"), so the
failure explains itself rather than needing the boot path to predict it. The
prompt reads keys through `KeyInput`, which works because init spawns the
console pump before this task — the same claim a full-screen program takes, a
few hundred milliseconds earlier than anything else has ever taken it.

**`/bin` is writable now, and that needed an answer.** It used to be immutable
by construction: a read-only archive mount refused a write below the VFS. One
store means one `writable()`, and `rm /bin/sh` is reachable from the prompt —
with a matching stamp, nothing would ever put it back, and the origin could not
boot again. So `no_shell` offers the unpack a second time. The rule that comes
out of it is worth stating plainly: **the archive, not the store, is what the
system can be recovered from**, which is also why it is never cached into the
store as bytes.

A per-file read-only flag was considered and rejected. OPFS has no such thing —
`FileSystemHandle` carries `kind` and `name` and nothing else, and
`createSyncAccessHandle({mode})` chooses a lock, not a protection — so it would
have to be Braam's own metadata, in a manifest or a sidecar, with no inode layer
to hang a bit on and nothing to keep a user from rewriting whatever held it.
With one user and no privilege boundary it would protect against accident only,
which the restore prompt already does.

**No OPFS is fatal, and that retires a criterion.** M5's third was "with OPFS
unavailable, the system boots on `MemFs` and says so", and it was a good
criterion while `/home` was the only thing at stake. It is not one now: there is
no second store, so a memory namespace would be a system that looks like it
works and loses everything at the reload — the failure mode the line was written
to prevent, arrived at by a different road. Boot says what is wrong and starts
no shell. The criteria list keeps it, struck, the way M8's third is kept.

**What the tests lost, and where it went.** `test_memfs` and `test_bundlefs` are
deleted with their subjects. `test_vfs` needed a writable filesystem that
answers *without suspending* — `run_now` panics on a suspension and `OpfsFs`
awaits the host for everything but a read — so it grew a `TempFs` beside the
`ReadOnlyFs` and `CountingFs` it already had. A fixture rather than a component:
flat, no `df` accounting, and honest about it in a comment.

`test/run.mjs` drives everything synchronously, and there is no synchronous
inflate. Rather than make the driver async — which would reach every assertion
in it — `parseZip` is separated from `installOps`: the parser is async and runs
once during the driver's own setup, and the generator of operations is plain and
runs inside the import. Both stores drive the same generator, so neither has its
own idea of what an archive means. It also made the one check worth writing by
hand cheap: an entry named `../escape` is put in front of the parser and has to
be refused.

## A release archive dated today

Every entry in `braam-<version>.zip` was stamped `01-01-1980 00:00`. That was
deliberate — see "0.1.0 — Packaging", below — and the reasoning stands: a zip
timestamp is the only difference between two packs of one tree, so fixing it is
what let `md5` answer "is what is deployed what I built?" without unpacking
anything.

It is the wrong default anyway. The determinism is worth something to one person
once in a while; the date is read by everyone, every time, in the `unzip -l`
that precedes a deployment, and in the mtime of every file the deployer unpacks.
1980 is not merely uninformative there — it is *wrong* in a way that reads as a
broken build, and the file it lands on looks older than everything around it for
as long as it survives. A property worth checking on demand lost to a property
being misread continuously.

So the stamp is the time the pack ran, and `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` puts the old
behaviour back exactly: set it and two packs of one tree are identical again.
That is the reproducible-builds convention rather than a flag of ours, so
whoever wants the guarantee already knows the name, and CI can pin it without
knowing anything about this script. Sorted entries and the fixed mode never
moved, so what changed is one field.

The two clocks are read differently on purpose. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is rendered
in UTC, because a stamp that moves with the packer's time zone is not pinned;
the pack time is rendered local, because a zip's date field is local time by
definition and has no zone to carry — rendering *that* in UTC would show a
deployer in Los Angeles a build seven hours in their future.

The commit date was the third candidate and is the tempting one: deterministic,
meaningful, and already at hand since `version.py` shells out to git. It says
when the *source* was written, which is not what the reader of an archive is
asking; a release cut a month after the last commit would be dated a month
early, and a tree with no repository — an unpacked release, which is a supported
way to build — has no such date at all, putting 1980 back for the case that has
the least context to interpret it.

## One handle per file, not one descriptor

`cat bar bar` said `cat: bar: permission denied`, and so did
`wc /bin/sh /bin/sh`, `grep x f f` and `grep one notes < notes`. The refusal
came from the VFS open-file table, which scanned for the absolute path and
refused *any* second open, system-wide, on every backend — including `/bin` and
`/proc`, which have no lock to protect.

That rule was deliberate, and the reasoning behind it (see "One open handle per
file", below) was right about the thing that mattered: OPFS's
`createSyncAccessHandle()` takes an exclusive lock, and a rule that held only on
some backends would be worse than the restriction. What was missed is that there
is a third option. The table now holds **one backend handle per file and hands
out references to it**. Nothing is ever asked to open a file twice, so the rule
is identical on OPFS, MemFs, BundleFs and ProcFs *without* being a restriction —
the property the strict rule was protecting, obtained by removing the strictness
rather than by spreading it.

Sharing is safe only because of something that was already true: the offset
lives in `FileIo`, above the VFS, and `vfs_read`/`vfs_write` take an absolute
one. "Nothing below it holds per-descriptor state" was an observation; it is now
a correctness precondition.

**Readers share, a writer keeps the file to itself.** That restores what §5.2
originally meant. Two writers would need a shared offset the VFS deliberately
does not have — `O_APPEND` is resolved once, at open, into `Handle::file.off`,
so `a >> f` and `b >> f` at the same time would overwrite rather than append,
and POSIX's atomicity is not available to us. Keeping `cat f > f` refused is a
feature the shell gets for free. `may_share()` is the one function to change if
that is ever revisited; it is also why `OpenShared::mutating` never needs
recomputing, since a record that has it can never gain a second descriptor.

`O_TRUNC` counts as writing even without `O_WRITE`. A share skips the backend
open, and the backend open is where a truncation happens, so an `O_READ|O_TRUNC`
open that shared would silently not truncate. `O_CREATE` needs no such care: if
a record exists, so does the file.

The old invariant already leaked. `vfs_open` scanned before
`co_await fs->open(...)` and installed after, so two tasks could both pass the
scan and both install; it only looked airtight because OPFS refused the second
host open. The re-scan after the await is what establishes "one record per file"
for the first time, and it needs no new scheduler primitive because nothing
between the re-scan and the bind suspends — whichever coroutine resumes first
installs its record atomically with respect to the other, and the loser always
sees it. On OPFS the loser's own open is exactly the one that failed, so the
failure becomes a share.

Two consequences worth writing down. `/proc` snapshots at open, so two
concurrent readers of one `/proc` file now see one snapshot; a per-backend
opt-out was rejected because it reintroduces the backend-dependent rule §5.2
refused. And two concurrent `O_WRITE|O_TRUNC` opens on MemFs leave the loser's
truncation already done before the re-scan refuses it — true before this change
as well, where the loser also truncated *and* succeeded, so it is strictly less
bad.

### The other half: `Input` opens lazily

The VFS change alone fixes `cat bar bar`, but `Input` was also opening every
named file up front, which is what made one command hold two descriptors on one
path. It now opens each file when the read reaches it and closes it before the
next, so at most one named file is open at a time. The header already claimed
this ("they are opened lazily") while the implementation did the opposite.

The price is real: `cat good missing` now prints `good`'s bytes *before*
reporting that `missing` does not exist, where the up-front open reported it
first. `head -n 2 good missing` never mentions `missing` at all, because it
stops before reaching it. Both are the honest consequence of laziness rather
than something to special-case.

`open_all` was deleted rather than renamed — it no longer opened anything, and
the only state it still set belongs in the constructor, which now takes `who` as
a third argument. That is an SDK-visible change to `include/braam/proc/io.h`.
The diagnostic moved into `read()`, which is the only place that knows the
file's name; every caller already mapped a non-`Closed` error onto an exit
status without printing, so none of the nine needed its loop touched.

The two changes are complementary, and it is worth being precise about which
covers what. Laziness fixes one process naming one file twice. Sharing is what
fixes `grep one notes < notes` — where `Sys::Spawn` moves the redirection's
handle into the child, which then opens the same path itself — along with
`cat bar | grep x bar` and two processes on one file. The end-to-end test
carries both.

Regression coverage is the uncomfortable part. `test/fakefs.mjs` does not model
OPFS's exclusive lock and was deliberately left permissive, so a shared-handle
path that regressed into issuing two host opens would sail through the whole
smoke test while a real browser threw `NoModificationAllowedError`. `test_vfs`'s
`CountingFs` counts what reaches the filesystem — two descriptors must be one
`open()` and one `close()` — and is the only thing standing between that
regression and a shipped build. The await window itself is not reachable from
`tests.wasm`: `run_now` panics on a suspension and every filesystem the suite
mounts answers synchronously.

Supersedes "One open handle per file" below, and the eight files in "What a
syscall costs, measured" no longer need to be different.

## A canvas is focusable, not editable

On a tablet the prompt appeared, a finger could select text, and nothing could
be typed: the software keyboard never came up. The canvas *was* focusable —
`tabindex="0"`, and `mount()` set it defensively as well — and that is the whole
of the bug. "Focusable" and "editable" are different predicates and only the
second raises a keyboard. Every key in the system entered through one `keydown`
listener on an element that could never receive one from a touch device.
Selection worked because it rides pointer events, which do fire for touch, which
is what made the failure look like a keyboard problem rather than a focus
problem.

So the focus moved to a hidden `<textarea>` that `mount()` creates, and the
canvas gives its focus away (`canvas.addEventListener("focus", focusSink)`)
rather than taking it.

**A textarea, not an `<input>`.** On both iPadOS and Android an input's return
key is "Go" or "Done" and blurs or submits instead of inserting a line break —
so `insertLineBreak` never arrives and Enter is unreachable from the soft
keyboard. That decides it on its own. `contenteditable` was the other candidate
and loses on the housekeeping: the browser injects `<br>`/`<div>` wrappers to
keep clearing, and `inputmode`/`enterkeyhint`/`autocapitalize` are not uniformly
honoured on it.

**Every declaration on the sink is load-bearing**, and each of them looks like
something to tidy up later:

- `opacity: 0` and not `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `hidden`,
  `readonly` or `disabled` — every one of those makes it unfocusable or kills
  the keyboard.
- `font-size: 16px` on an invisible element, because iOS Safari zooms the page
  when focus lands on a field under 16px. That is the correct fix;
  `maximum-scale=1` in the viewport meta is the other one and it disables
  pinch-zoom for everyone.
- Positioned at the viewport origin rather than off-screen. `top: -9999px` is
  the usual trick and is wrong here: iOS scrolls the focused field into view and
  would take the terminal with it. A 1×1 transparent box already in view gives
  scroll-into-view nothing to do.
- `pointer-events: none`, so the 1px corner cannot eat a tap meant for the
  canvas.
- `position: fixed` on `document.body` rather than a wrapper around the canvas.
  Wrapping reparents an element the page laid out: in `embed.html` the canvas is
  the `1fr` row of a two-row grid sized by `height: 100%`, and a `<div>` between
  them leaves that `100%` resolving against nothing — the terminal collapses.
  Fixed positioning is out of flow, and `dispose()` is one `remove()`. It is the
  shape `filePicker()` already had.

### Two sources, one destination, and the rule between them

A soft keyboard frequently reports no key at all: GBoard sends `keyCode 229`
with `key: "Unidentified"` for ordinary letters. iPadOS is better and sends real
`keydown`s for typing — but dictation, predictive text and autocorrect arrive
there only as `input` events. So a second route was needed on both platforms,
for different reasons, and the risk it brings is a keystroke delivered twice.

The invariant that prevents it: **the text route runs exactly when the key route
did not prevent the default.** `preventDefault()` on a keydown suppresses the
insertion and therefore the `beforeinput` and `input` that would have followed,
and `consumes()` returns true for every printable key. Its two early-outs are
the whole risk surface and both are covered — `key === null` is the *intended*
handoff (and now also makes a Mac dead key compose, which was silently dropped
before), and the `metaKey`/`RESERVED` cases cannot produce an insertion the
handler does not filter. The `keyCode === 229` guard at the top of `onKeyDown`
is the converse: those keydowns post nothing and prevent nothing, so the text
route gets them.

The text route reads `sink.value` rather than `event.data`, because the firing
order of `input` and `compositionend` differs between engines — Chrome fires
`input(insertCompositionText)` first, Safari has fired it after. Reading and
clearing the value makes the order irrelevant: whichever handler arrives first
takes the text and empties the field, and the other finds nothing. Deletion is
the exception and is taken on `beforeinput`, because a delete on an
already-empty field changes nothing, and a UA that changes nothing fires no
`input`.

### Why the text route feeds a paste run

Reusing `{kind:"paste"}` means no new worker message kind and no worker change
at all, and it inherits the pacing against `key()`'s return value that a
dictated sentence needs. The third reason is the one that is easy to miss:
`web/worker.js` dispatches a `{kind:"key"}` straight into `kernel.key()`,
*ahead* of a `pasting` run still being fed. That is deliberate and documented
there — `^C` must not wait behind a paste — but it means a backspace posted as a
key while the word before it was still draining would arrive first. So text,
`Enter`, backspace and delete all go as a run, and the single deliberate
exception is the character after a latched `Ctrl`, which uses `sendKey`
*because* it jumps the queue: that one is `^C`.

Nothing here crosses the wasm boundary. A `text(ptr, len)` export would be the
same inversion that "Paste, as typing" already rejected for a `paste()` export —
a byte stream into the keyboard, with §2.3 turned inside out — and the
exact-surface assertion in `test/run.mjs` went unedited, which is the evidence
the change stayed on the page.

### The key bar, and who owns its DOM

Fixing the keyboard still leaves a tablet unable to send `^C`: neither iPadOS
nor GBoard offers `Ctrl` or `Esc`, and most layouts have no `Tab` and no arrows.
Nothing in the input pipeline can synthesise a key the keyboard does not have,
so the page supplies them.

**The page places the container and `mount()` fills it**
(`mount({canvas, keys})`). The alternative — `mount()` creating and inserting
the bar — breaks `embed.html`'s two-row grid, and forces this file to inject
styling into a page whose theme it does not know; `braam.js` sets no CSS on
anything the embedder owns, and that would have been the first exception. With a
page-placed container the layout is the page's and the existing `ResizeObserver`
does the rest for free: the bar is a real flex item, so when it appears the
canvas shrinks, the observer fires and the grid re-lays out. `dispose()` gets an
unambiguous rule too — remove the buttons `mount()` made, leave the container it
did not, which is `ownPicker` again.

Showing it is a CSS media query in the page, `any-pointer: coarse` rather than
`pointer: coarse`: an iPad with a Magic Keyboard reports a fine primary pointer
and still has a touchscreen its owner may type on. The worst case is a bar a
keyboard user ignores. `navigator.maxTouchPoints` is the same information but
static, and reads true under desktop device emulation. Because the container is
`display: none` on desktop it has zero height, so the desktop terminal is
unchanged.

`Ctrl` latches onto the next key and clears; a second tap toggles it off and a
blur clears it. **No lock-on-double-tap** — a stuck `Ctrl` is a terminal that
appears broken, and there is nowhere on a seven-button bar to explain a second
state. Routing the latch through the text route as well as through `onKeyDown`
is load-bearing: on Android the `c` of `^C` arrives as input text, not as a
keystroke.

The one genuinely delicate part is that **tapping a button must not dismiss the
keyboard**. Preventing `mousedown`'s default is what holds the focus on the
sink; it is the toolbar-button idiom every rich-text editor uses, and a tap
synthesises compatibility mouse events before its click. `preventDefault()` on
`pointerdown` is *specified* to suppress those while still firing `click`, but
an engine that got that wrong would leave the bar silently dead on exactly the
platform it exists for. Acting on `click` also gives mouse, touch and keyboard
activation one path with no double-fire, and `touch-action: manipulation`
removes the latency that would otherwise cost.

### The keyboard covers the page rather than resizing it

None of this went into `braam.js`. Resizing or scrolling an embedder's document
is the layout meddling the file refuses everywhere else, and it does not need
to: the `ResizeObserver` already reflows the grid the moment the canvas box
changes, so a page that shrinks correctly gets a correct terminal for free. What
`index.html` does is `interactive-widget=resizes-content` for Android — the
default is `resizes-visual`, which slides the page instead — `100dvh` for the
URL bar, and a `visualViewport` listener for iOS, which shrinks neither the
layout nor the dynamic viewport for its keyboard and appears to ignore
`interactive-widget` entirely. `embed.html` takes the meta and the `dvh` and not
the listener, since page-fitting logic muddies what that page is there to show.

### Three things left uncertain on purpose

Each has a contingency that should not be paid for speculatively, and each is a
question only a real device answers:

- **Android backspace on an empty field.** Some GBoard versions send a real
  `keydown`/`keyCode 8` even while sending 229 for letters; others send only
  `beforeinput(deleteContentBackward)`. Both are handled. If some UA suppresses
  even the `beforeinput`, the fix is the sentinel CodeMirror uses — seed the
  sink with two no-break spaces, keep the caret between them, and diff on drain
  — which costs autocorrect context and makes a screen reader read the sentinel.
- **GBoard composing whole words.** `spellcheck="false"` and `autocorrect="off"`
  make it much less inclined to, but if it does, the echo lags to word
  boundaries. It works; it lags. The fix would be an incremental emitter diffing
  `sink.value` against what has already been sent.
- **Re-raising a keyboard the user dismissed.** The sink still holds the focus,
  so a tap focuses an already-focused element, which on iOS does not bring the
  keyboard back. A `blur()` before the `focus()` is the candidate and may not
  work either, at the cost of a flicker on every tap.

### Verification

There is no browser harness in this tree, so the three CTest cases prove only
what they always prove — and here that is the point: `smoke` asserting the exact
import and export surface is the check that this stayed on the page side. The
behaviour was checked by hand, in a browser and on a tablet, against the list in
the section above.

## Concept.md says what the system is, not how it got here

The spec had accumulated its own history. Half of it was written in the past
tense about the present: "M5's `/bin` was `BinFs`", "this section once said it
would", "a `host_fetch` was on the list too, and that is not what M6 built",
"the cost is paid twice over" with the byte counts of a model that no longer
exists. Every one of those was true and every one of them was an amendment
narrated rather than applied — a reader had to follow the argument to the end to
find out what the rule *is*. It is 1,303 lines down to about 950, and what went
was the narration, not a decision.

The division of labour is the one CLAUDE.md already states and the spec was not
keeping: this file holds the *why*, Concept.md holds the *what*. So a paragraph
that ended in a rule keeps the rule and loses the case for it, because the case
is here under the note that argued it. Nothing was deleted that is not either
still in the spec as a statement or already in this file as a section — the
applet's byte counts are in "One program model", `BinFs` is in M5 and M6, the
unbuilt `host_random` is in "System_Calls.md, and what writing it found", and
the measured syscall cost is in "What a syscall costs, measured".

**Nothing was renumbered**, because the numbering is cited from source comments
— thirty-one citations of §4.3 alone. Two sections changed what they contain
instead:

- **§6 was "Milestones" and is now "Host services".** The milestones were a
  pointer to this file and a note that the section kept its number, which is a
  heading holding a place for nothing. `src/proc/io.h` already cited §6 for the
  wall clock — a citation that meant M6 and landed on the milestone list — so
  filling §6 with fetch, WebSocket, the clipboard, file transfer and the clock
  makes an existing citation right rather than breaking a live one. The material
  came from the scattered halves of §3.4 and §5.4 that described those services
  and never named them together.
- **Appendix D was provenance** — three earlier design notes consolidated, and
  the one disagreement between them resolved in favour of the process model.
  That is the definition of history in a spec, and it is deleted rather than
  moved: the notes are gone, the disagreement was settled two milestones before
  every program became a binary, and §4 states the outcome flatly.

**Reading it against the source found four numbers that had rotted**, which is
the argument for the trim in one line: a spec that narrates is a spec nobody
re-checks. `PROC_TASKS` was quoted as four and is eight; the child bounds were
"eight live children, eight levels deep" and are `SYS_CHILD_MAX` sixteen and
`SYS_PROC_DEPTH` eight; the renderer was "under 200 lines" and is about 300. All
three now name the constant or round honestly, because a constant that moves
should not need this document edited. (CLAUDE.md repeats the `PROC_TASKS` figure
and is wrong the same way.) The fourth was §7's repository layout, which listed
no `examples/` and no `Programming_Manual.md`.

Three other things changed in kind rather than in length. The §3 diagram now
draws the process worker with its imports and exports, since a process is a peer
of the kernel worker and was described in prose under a "(M9+)" label. §4.3's
rules about the operation table were four paragraphs of when-and-why and are now
four named rules — a caller in `src/cmd/`, the synchronous half closed at four,
a stream is a descriptor, and text under `/proc` is not a syscall — which is
what someone adding an operation actually needs to check. And §8 lost "early"
from its title: the five things in it are standing constraints, not advice to a
project that has not started.

## The plan is deleted, and its figures are here

`doc/TODO.md` was the plan for putting every program in a worker of its own —
nine items, T1 to T9, written before anything moved and annotated as each was
finished. Every one of them has a note of its own further down this file, so
what the plan still held once T9 was done was a to-do list with nothing to do,
plus two things that were not written anywhere else: **the measured figures**,
and **the one measurement that was never taken**. It is deleted and those are
here. The T-numbers are kept as citations — this file and CLAUDE.md refer to
"the plan's T5" and mean this — and there is nothing left in the plan that is a
work item.

The figures are a record, not something to re-run: `make bench` was the harness,
and it was deleted with tier 2 ("Tier 2 is deleted" below), because its three
arms were an A/B between two program models and there is one. The counters it
read are still there and still unconditional — `makeProc`'s `stats()`, and
`paint`/`tick` plus the `stats` and `render` messages in `web/worker.js` — so a
page that wants to measure again has what it needs.

### The method, and why it is a difference

"What a syscall costs, measured" below has the reasoning in full; the short of
it is that the number is ΔT/ΔN over two runs of the *same command* — `wc` over
one file against `wc` over eight — so the spawn, the compile-cache hit, the
instantiate, the exit and the prompt redraw all subtract out, and ΔN is read out
of counters rather than predicted from `SYS_CHUNK`. Both runs below are ten
timed runs after two warm-ups, medians, on the same 8-core Mac, in three
engines. Gecko and WebKit step `performance.now()` in whole milliseconds without
cross-origin isolation, so their columns are quantised — 297 round trips into a
1 ms grid is a ±3.4 µs quantum, and a 0.00 ms keystroke is a clock step rather
than a free one.

### T1, before anything moved — 0.2.44-e6a8552

A round trip, in microseconds:

| | Blink (Vivaldi) | Gecko (Firefox) | WebKit (Safari) |
|---|---|---|---|
| every program at tier 2 (as it shipped then) | 40.2 | 80.8 | 5.1 |
| the same, less the every-64th timer wait | 6.2 | 16.8 | 1.7 |
| every program at tier 3 | 42.3 | 33.7 | 33.7 |

So §4.4's *"order 0.1 ms"* was two to three times pessimistic and a worker of
one's own cost about **30–40 µs a round trip**: `wc` of 86 KB went from 4.2 ms
to 11.4 ms in Blink and 6.5 to 12 in WebKit. The middle row is the finding that
mattered most at the time — most of tier 2's bulk cost was `web/worker.js`'s
every-64th `setTimeout(drain, 0)`, which waited 1.3 ms in Blink, 2.4 in Gecko
and 0.25 in WebKit, and which a worker of one's own never took.

A keystroke, in milliseconds, key to the last repaint it caused:

| | Blink | Gecko | WebKit |
|---|---|---|---|
| tier-2 shell | 0.17 | 1.66 | 0.36 |
| tier-3 shell | 0.63 | 1.89 | 3.26 |
| 64 keys back to back, per key | 0.10 → 0.34 | 0.42 → 2.70 | 0.27 → 5.09 |

Nothing was dropped at either tier in any engine — the ring holds 64 — but
sustained typing at 2.7 ms a key in Gecko and 5.1 in WebKit is a shell that
feels slow while it is being typed into, and that is the number T7 and T8 had to
answer to. WebKit's pass was marked tainted (its tab lost focus mid-session), so
its absolute milliseconds are the weakest column here; its round-trip and
keystroke *ratios* agree with the other two, which is the check that matters.

### T5, with thirty-one programs moved — 0.2.47-8ca8053

The gate on the other side of T3, and the decision not to write T6. Same method,
three arms — every program at tier 2, tier 3 but for the shell (what shipped
then), tier 3 including the shell (what ships now) — with T1's figure in
brackets. No pass was tainted and no keystroke was dropped.

A round trip, in microseconds:

| | Blink | Gecko | WebKit |
|---|---|---|---|
| every program at tier 2 | 41.8 (40.2) | 79.1 (80.8) | 10.1 (5.1) |
| tier 3 but for the shell | **44.9** (42.3) | **38.7** (33.7) | **33.7** (33.7) |
| tier 3, shell included | 47.0 (44.4) | 40.4 (38.7) | 35.4 (38.7) |

WebKit's 5.1 → 10.1 on the first row is one grid step, not a regression.

A keystroke, in milliseconds:

| | Blink | Gecko | WebKit |
|---|---|---|---|
| every program at tier 2 | 0.20 | 2.00 | 0.00 |
| tier 3 but for the shell | **0.20** | **2.00** | **0.00** |
| tier 3, shell included | 0.65 | 2.00 | 3.00 |
| 64 keys, per key — tier 3 but for the shell | 0.09–0.12 | 0.41–0.42 | 0.25–0.27 |
| 64 keys, per key — tier 3, shell included | 0.27–0.28 | 2.58–2.62 | 6.20–6.25 |

The shipped row was the tier-2 control's row to the clock in all three engines,
which is what says the keystroke's cost was the *shell's* tier and not the
programs'. T1's alarming figures were never the shipped system's; they were the
tier-3-shell arm's, and in WebKit that arm got *worse* on the re-run.

Bulk I/O, in milliseconds, which is what the T6 decision turned on:

| | Blink | Gecko | WebKit |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wc /bin/sh` — tier 2 | 4.2 (4.2) | 9.5 (9.0) | 6.0 (6.5) |
| `wc /bin/sh` — tier 3 but for the shell | 11.0 (11.4) | 15.5 (16.0) | 12.0 (12.0) |
| `wc` over eight files — tier 2 | 16.6 (16.2) | 33.0 (33.0) | 9.0 (8.0) |
| `wc` over eight files — tier 3 but for the shell | 24.4 (24.0) | **27.0** (26.0) | 22.0 (22.0) |
| `cat /bin/sh \| cat \| wc` — tier 2 | 7.8 (7.7) | 13.0 (13.0) | 9.5 (11.5) |
| `cat /bin/sh \| cat \| wc` — tier 3 but for the shell | 19.7 (25.6) | 26.0 (30.0) | 19.0 (27.0) |

The tier cost **10–13 ms** on the heaviest thing in the suite — a quarter of a
megabyte through three processes — and 6–7 ms on an 86 KB file. In Gecko `wc`
over eight files was *faster* than with everything at tier 2, because the
every-64th timer had retired itself: as shipped that command took the slow route
zero times, since the only tier-2 process left was the shell and it takes 21
steps rather than 483. All of it is round trips and none of it is the worker —
`true`, one spawn and one exit with no I/O, cost the same either way to within
1.5 ms in every engine, because the pool has a worker waiting.

### The bar T8 was taken against

Sustained typing, 64 keys back to back, milliseconds per key:

| | tier-2 shell (T5) | tier-3 shell as T5 measured | bar |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blink | 0.09–0.12 | 0.27–0.28 | ≤ 0.20 |
| Gecko | 0.41–0.42 | 2.58–2.62 | ≤ 0.90 |
| WebKit | 0.25–0.27 | 6.20–6.25 | ≤ 0.90 |

plus zero dropped keystrokes and no regression beyond the clock on the bulk
figures. "Under a frame" was explicitly *not* the bar: 6.2 ms a key is already
under a frame, and T5 called it a shell that feels slow, correctly. Cutting the
keystroke from five round trips to two ("A repaint is one syscall") is what got
under it.

### The measurement that was never taken

T8 instrumented an attribution A/B and never ran it, and the harness for it is
gone. The question is live and worth stating, because the arithmetic does not
close: **five round trips at the measured 34–45 µs is 0.25 ms, which was Blink's
tier-3 keystroke to the clock, 13× short of Gecko's and 35× short of WebKit's.**
So Blink's keystroke *was* its round trips and the other two engines' was not.
The only per-turn asymmetry between the prompt's round trips and `wc`'s anywhere
in the tree is that the prompt's damage the grid and the kernel worker presents
once per tick — a repaint of four operations painted the same keystroke three
times, which is why the cursor had to be hidden through one or it would be seen
walking the line. The A/B was a burst with drawing turned off against the same
burst lit: if the dark one drops to the lit one's figure the residual is the
canvas commit per task, and if it does not, the bare worker↔worker turn is slow
on that path.

`echo` has since made the repaint one operation and one present, so whichever
answer it would have given, most of what it was measuring is no longer being
paid.

### T6, which was never started and should not be started on a guess

T5 decided against it and the decision stands: what would reopen it is a
workload, not a figure — something moving megabytes rather than a quarter of
one, where 34–45 µs per 512 bytes is 70–90 ms a megabyte. Neither of its two
shapes is cheap, and this is what they were:

- **A bigger `SYS_CHUNK`.** It is 512 because that is the allocator's top size
  class on both sides of the wire (§8.2); raising it costs a 64 KiB span per
  buffer, so it is an allocator change as much as an ABI one.
- **Batching the replies.** The step protocol already carries a *list* of parked
  calls up and exactly one reply down — `_resume(token, ptr, len)` answers one
  call. Batching means the kernel coalescing the steps it owes one pid, both
  halves of `web/proc.js`, `web/procworker.js`, `test/fakeworker.mjs`, and an
  amendment to System_Calls.md.

---

## A prompt is one syscall

The plan's T8 cut the keystroke and said outright what it had not cut:
`anchor()` is seven round trips, `interactive()` adds a `cwd_get`, and *"Enter
to the next prompt is an order of magnitude more than a keystroke — the next
thing anyone will notice"*. This is that.

**Enter to the next prompt was twelve round trips and is five**, measured the
way the keystroke was — `net.proc.stats().calls` across one Enter at an empty
prompt in `test/run.mjs`'s driver reads 12 before and 5 after, and a keystroke
reads 2 either side. Both spans run from one parked `key_read` to the next, so
the five are the `Echo` that repaints the committed line, the newline that ends
its row, the `cwd_get` the next prompt names, the `Echo` that draws it, and the
`key_read`. The seven that went were `anchor()`'s: a `cursor` get, a
`style`+`write` for the directory, a `style`+`write` for the prompt proper, a
`style` to put the default back, a second `cursor` get — nine when a failed
status put a fourth colour in front — plus the `cursor` set that followed it.

**`Sys::Echo`'s bytes are a sequence of styled runs.** A run is a style word and
a length, every header ahead of every byte; `SYS_ECHO_FRESH` and `SYS_ECHO_END`
in the op word carry what the two `cursor` gets were for. The §4.3 table is
still thirty-six and `PROC_ABI` is 8. `anchor()` is one call with four runs —
red status, white-on-blue directory, bright-white prompt, and a run with no
bytes that puts the default back — and `redraw()` is one run of
`SYS_STYLE_KEEP`, which is why the keystroke is unchanged rather than merely
un-regressed.

Four things are worth recording about the shape it took.

- **`SYS_STYLE_KEEP` is load-bearing, not a convenience.** Without a style that
  means *leave the sticky one alone*, a run could not be exactly a `Write`, and
  `Echo` would stop being a composition of operations that already exist — which
  is the sentence the previous note rests on and the constraint this one was
  designed under. A run is a `Style` and a `Write`, `FRESH` is a `Cursor` get
  and a conditional newline, `END` is not calling `Cursor` afterwards. Nothing
  here reaches a cell, a claim or a stream the caller could not already reach.
- **It fixed a colour bug nobody had reported.** `blank()` takes the *current*
  `g_fg`/`g_bg`, and `scroll()` clears the new bottom row with it. The old
  `anchor()` put its leading newline inside the first non-empty coloured run, so
  with a directory and no failed status that newline went out white-on-blue —
  and every prompt drawn at the bottom of a full screen left a blue bar from the
  `$` to the right margin. `FRESH` writes it before any run's style. It is the
  concrete form of "whoever sets a colour puts the default back", violated for
  exactly one byte, and `test/run.mjs` pins it now: six `echo -n`s on a 24×4
  grid, then every column past the prompt must be on black.
- **Two bits rather than one.** `FRESH` and `END` answer different questions —
  where the write starts, where the cursor rests — and each independently kills
  one payload field, `FRESH` the anchor and `END` the cursor offset. One
  combined bit would have retired all three fields at once and left the next
  reader wondering why they were in the payload at all. Neither is a sentinel in
  `x`/`y` either: `FRESH` is an action, not a coordinate, and a sentinel would
  be invisible in the constants table.
- **The `cwd_get` stays, and that is a decision.** A prompt at four round trips
  instead of five is available for the price of `cd` stashing what `cwd_set`
  already hands back. It was refused when the directory went into the prompt and
  it is refused again for the same reason: `cd` being the only thing that moves
  the shell is true today and is not a property anything enforces, and a wrong
  prompt is believed. Five is the floor while that holds.

The rejected alternatives. **Keeping a thin `cursor_echo(…, bool on, Str s)`
overload** for `redraw()` would have made `cursor_echo(x, y, cur, 1, s)` convert
to both `bool` and `u32` — a trap `-Werror` does not catch — and it could not
have been a plain forwarder, because a `Task` is eager and a local `StyledRun`
on a forwarder's stack would be correct only by accident; making it a real
coroutine costs a second frame per keystroke, on the one path this change exists
to protect. `redraw()` builds a one-element array instead. **Deleting `Cursor`
and `Style`**, which this leaves with no caller in the tree, was refused: `Echo`
is their fused form for the caller that pays a round trip apiece, not their
replacement, and a program colouring a word on stdout has no anchor to name and
does not want a row of its own. Deleting now is free and re-adding later is an
ABI bump that invalidates every stamped binary and every installed SDK. **A
third bit `HERE`** — anchor at the cursor, no newline — would have let `Echo`
subsume `Style`+`Write` and taken the table to thirty-four, but it makes the
cheap thing require the expensive shape and adds a bit with no caller in
`src/cmd/`, breaking the rule it is invoked to satisfy. **Interleaving the run
headers with their bytes** costs the single bounded validation pass: with the
headers first the kernel checks the count, the table and the summed lengths
before it reads a byte, rather than deriving each bound from the previous read
the way `argv_at` has to.

One correction while here: the alignment argument for headers-first, which is
the obvious one, is false in this codebase. `sys_get_u32` is four byte loads and
nothing in a staged payload is ever an aligned access — `ScreenBlit` is the one
place alignment matters, and that is why *its* header is a fixed seven words.

---

## Tier 2 is deleted

Every binary in the tree has asked for a worker of its own since T8, and
`stamp.py --tier` has been required rather than defaulted since the same change
— so what was left of the second program model was a *fallback*: the path a host
took when it could not make a worker. It cost a second syscall path in
`web/proc.js`, a deferral mechanism in `web/worker.js` that existed only to
drain it, a three-armed bench harness, a word on the wire, and a public knob in
the SDK. All of it stood behind a case nothing in the tree exercised and no test
could reach without turning the workers off by hand.

It is gone. One program model, one syscall path, and §4's table has one row.

### The word leaves the wire

`ProcMeta` is five `u32`s rather than six and `PROC_ABI` is 7. The alternative
was keeping the field and requiring 3, which is a smaller diff and leaves a
one-value enum on the ABI for a reader to wonder about. The field's second job —
`Tier::Retired = 1`, so a binary from before M8 was refused rather than misread
— is what the `abi` word does, and does for every amendment rather than for that
one, so nothing is reserved in its place.

`proc_pack` gets simpler with it: the tier was a nibble at the top of the flags
word, which is why `max_pages` had twelve bits and a `static_assert` defending
them. It has sixteen now.

### A wait, not a fallback

The question the fallback answered still has to be answered: what does a host
that cannot make a nested worker do? The choice taken is to **pause and retry**
— 10 ms, then 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and a second from there on, printing
`no worker, retrying` on the program's own stderr each time — rather than fail
the command or refuse at boot.

Failing the command was the obvious alternative and is worse in the case that
matters: the process most likely to want a worker when none can be had is
`/bin/sh` itself, at boot or after `dropWorkers()`, and a session that ends with
one line is less useful than one that says what it is waiting for and starts the
moment it can. Refusing at boot with a "this browser cannot run Braam" screen
was the other, and it decides too early: a host that has *lost* its workers is
not a host that never had them, and the retry covers both without having to tell
them apart.

The loop lives in `spawn_process` in `src/user/exec.cpp` — a coroutine of its
own rather than straight-line code inside `exec_process`, because
`exec_process`'s frame is on the path `test_shell` guards and a frame past 512
bytes costs a whole 64 KiB span. `sleep_ms` is cancellation-aware like every
awaitable since M1, so `^C` abandons a wait and a cancelled job unwinds it with
nothing written for it.

One wrinkle decided the shape: `proc_spawn` takes `String &&image` and the
request record adopts it, which is §4.4's "a process image is tens of kilobytes
and the caller has one already". A retry therefore has no image left. Re-reading
the file with `read_file` before each attempt after the first was preferred to
passing a `Str` and copying, because that copy would be paid on every `exec` in
exchange for a path that only runs when the system is already degraded and has
ten milliseconds to spare.

Init's respawn bound is untouched and is no longer reachable this way: a shell
that is *waiting* for a worker has not started, so it is not one of the three
deaths that end a session.

### The latch had to go with it

`web/proc.js` kept a `workers` boolean, set false the first time a worker
refused to be made or failed to load, after which nothing hired again. That was
right when the answer to no worker was a permanent fallback; it is wrong when
the answer is to ask again, since a latch that never clears makes recovery
impossible. `hire()` now tries each time and the kernel's backoff is what keeps
the asking cheap.

The cost is one dead worker per hire on a host whose `procworker.js` will not
load, and `test/run.mjs` asserts exactly that rather than leaving it implied.
Note the asymmetry it exposes, which is not new but is now the only behaviour: a
worker that is never *made* is `Again` and retried, while one that is made and
then fails to load is a process that **died**, because by then the spawn has
been answered and the program is in its first step. The second is bounded by
init's three respawns, not by the backoff.

`link.ready` went with the latch — it had no other reader. The `{ k: "ready" }`
message stays on the wire, dropped on the floor as it was before T2 gave it a
job.

### What the bench measured is not measurable any more

`make bench` existed to A/B the two tiers: `bundle2.bin` and `bundle3nosh.bin`,
packed by re-stamping the staged binaries, against the shipped archive. With one
tier there is no A/B, so the cmake target, `web/bench.html`, `web/bench.js` and
`tools/bench.mjs` are deleted, along with the `defer` counters in
`web/worker.js` that only its arms read. T1, T5 and T8's figures stay recorded
at the top of this file, under the plan they belonged to.

Deleting `tools/release.py`'s `SKIP` set resolved a live bug on the way: it
named `bundle3.bin` while the cmake target emitted `bundle3nosh.bin`, so that
twin was packed into the released site zip whenever `bench` had been run in the
same tree.

### What it costs elsewhere

M8's acceptance criterion "tier selection comes from binary metadata" is retired
rather than broken: there is no selection. The criteria list below keeps it as
the record of what M8 built.

The kernel grew by 1,297 bytes — 142,473 to 143,770, against a 256 KiB budget —
which is the retry coroutine costing more than the tier checks and the `Tier`
enum saved. `bundle.bin` lost 128 bytes, four from each binary's section, and
rounds to the same 497 KB because the archive is block-aligned.

`test/run.mjs` gained a case and lost one. The old fallback case — workers off,
`dropWorkers()`, then assert a program still runs — asserted the thing being
deleted; in its place the same setup asserts the retry: the shell dies, the line
appears, the backoff prints two more on the driver's own clock, nothing binds a
worker while there is none to bind, and the session comes back when
`net.workers` goes true again. It is still last but for `exit`, for the reason
it always was.

---

## The shell takes a worker

The plan's T8, and the end of "every program at tier 3":
`set(BRAAM_BIN_TIER_sh 2)` is gone, `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt` passes no `TIER` at
all, and there is no name left in §4's tier table. `stamp.py`'s `--tier` is
required rather than defaulting to 2, which had become the answer no caller
wants.

**Two things had to be true first, and neither was about the stamp.** T7 made a
lost worker cost a shell rather than the session — init replaces one that *died*
— and the section above made a keystroke two round trips where it was five. The
order was not incidental: T1 and T5 both measured a tier-3 shell at 2.6 ms a key
in Gecko and 6.2 in WebKit while it was being typed into, and §4.4 said in as
many words that the prompt was the one program that could not afford the tier.
Flipping the stamp on its own would have shipped that.

**What the flip itself cost is nothing in C++.** The tier is a `u32` in a
fixed-width custom section, so no binary moved a byte and `bundle.bin` is the
size it was.

### The bench arms turned over

`bundle.bin` is now the `t3` arm — every program at tier 3 — so `bundle3.bin`
would have been a duplicate of it, which is the mirror image of what T5 fixed
for `bundle3nosh.bin`. The twin that is now missing is the one that does *not*
ship, so `make bench` packs `bundle3nosh.bin` instead, and it takes a single
re-stamp of `sh` rather than a pass over all thirty-two. The ids still mean what
they meant at T1, which is the point of them: `t2`, `t3nosh`, `t3`. Which of
them ships has moved twice and is not part of what they name.

### Four test cases changed meaning, not numbers

`dropWorkers()` takes the shell's worker now, and that is a different sentence
in every case that called it.

- **The held-step case is stronger than it was.** It asserts that a worker taken
  away with a step in it has that step *failed* by whoever took it. Before T8 a
  missed failure was a prompt that never came back; it is a session that never
  comes back now, because the shell parked for ever on a reply is the shell
  nobody will replace. The expected screen is `braam: the shell died` and a
  **bare** prompt rather than the killed command's status — the shell that would
  have printed the status died in the same breath — followed by a command on the
  replacement, which proves the tier came back too: `dropWorkers` lets go of the
  workers, not of the tier.
- **The broken-worker case had stopped testing what it said.** As written it set
  `net.broken` and then dropped the workers, which killed the shell into a world
  where every worker fails to load: init would re-exec, the replacement would
  die at its first step, `broke()` would set `workers` false, and the third
  shell would come up at tier 2 — so by the time the case ran its command the
  tier was already off and the command *succeeded* where the assertion wanted a
  crash. It empties the pool with a two-stage pipeline instead: one stage takes
  the last idle worker, the second has to hire and gets the broken link, and the
  shell keeps the good worker it was already holding. The case is about a
  program again.
- **`net.proc.kill(2)` reaches a worker** rather than merely dropping a record,
  so it asserts exactly one termination. That case is now literally what T8
  risks instead of a stand-in for it.
- **The fallback case is where the shell dies for the last time**, and it needed
  one keystroke it did not need before: the kernel learns its shell is gone when
  it next tries to *step* it, and at a prompt the shell is parked on `key_read`
  with nothing outstanding to fail. So a key is spent provoking the death, and
  goes with the shell it reached.

**And the driver had to learn about `RESPAWN_TRIES`.** Init gives up after three
deaths inside a second of *scheduler* time, and scheduler time in `test/run.mjs`
is whatever literal `run()` is passed. The tail of the file killed the shell
three times inside twelve milliseconds of it, which ends the session at "the
shell will not stay up" before `exit 7` is ever reached. The blocks are now
seconds apart on that clock, with a comment saying why, because the next case
inserted there will need the same spacing and nothing else would say so.

One thing that is not a test change but reads like one: `instantiate()` calls
`net.proc.shutdown()` now. `makeProc` is built once and outlives the three
kernels the driver boots, and a reload throws every nested worker away — so
without it the outgoing shell's record was overwritten by the incoming one at
the same pid and its worker was orphaned, never pooled and never terminated. It
moved the pool literals (18 hired and 16 terminated at the first, 23 and 20 at
the second) as much as the flip did.

### What did not change

The wasm ABI, the §4.3 table, `web/proc.js`, `web/procworker.js`, and the
process runtime. The two tier-3 fidelity losses (§4.3) stop being true of
thirty-one programs and start being true of thirty-two: a binary that will not
instantiate reads as a crash rather than a refusal, and `Sys::Now` is relative.
Nothing calls `proc_now()`, so the second is still a constraint on what may be
written next rather than a regression.

## A repaint is one syscall

The plan's T8, first half. T1 and T5 both measured the same thing and said it
twice: a shell at tier 3 costs 0.27 ms a key in Blink, 2.6 in Gecko and 6.2 in
WebKit while it is being typed into, against 0.09, 0.41 and 0.25 at tier 2. T5
called that "the strongest thing in this table" and §4.4 went further — *"the
only program that cannot afford it is the one being typed into"*. So the flip
could not be a stamp change alone; the keystroke had to get cheaper first.

**A keystroke was five round trips and is two**, measured rather than counted:
the fake driver's `calls2` across one key at the prompt reads 5 before and 2
after. The five were `key_read`, then `redraw()`'s `cursor` to the anchor,
`write` of the whole line, `cursor` again to find out what had scrolled, and
`cursor` to put the cursor where the caller wanted it. Four operations, and
**one** change to the grid.

`Sys::Echo` at 71 is those four. Its payload is the anchor and how many cells
past it to leave the cursor, then the bytes; its reply is where the cursor
ended, the geometry, and `scrolled`. `PROC_ABI` is 6 and the §4.3 table is
thirty-six.

Three things are worth recording about the shape it took.

- **`scrolled` is a counter, not an inference.** The old code wrote, asked where
  the write had ended, and subtracted that from where it should have ended — the
  shortfall being how far the grid had moved, since nothing counted scrolls.
  `screen_scrolled()` counts them now, and `Echo` reports the difference across
  itself. A resize's drop from the top is folded in at the same point, because
  that is also the grid moving up under an anchor, and the old inference could
  not see it at all once `cols` had changed underneath.
- **The dark-while-painting dance is gone.** `redraw()` hid the cursor before
  the write and showed it after, and the comment said why: each call was a step
  of its own, the grid is presented at the end of every tick, so a visible
  cursor would be *seen* walking the line. One operation is one tick. There is
  nothing to hide from, and a keystroke now paints the screen once where it
  painted it three times — which matters more than the round trips if what a
  tier-3 keystroke actually costs turns out to be the canvas commit rather than
  the transit.
- **It authorises nothing new.** Everything `Echo` does, four existing
  operations could already do, to the same screen, under the same refusal:
  `Err(Perm)` while another process holds the alternate screen, `Cursor`'s rule
  for `Cursor`'s reason. The bytes go through `p.io.out`, the same `Stream`
  `Sys::Write` uses, so a redirected stdout behaves exactly as it did. What it
  removes is three windows in which another process could move the cursor under
  a repaint in progress.

The rejected alternatives, since both are cheaper and neither is enough.
**Skipping the post-write `cursor` when the paint cannot reach the bottom row**
is a real saving of one call in five and is subsumed by this. **An append-only
fast path** — write the one new character, no cursor calls at all — is 5 → 2 for
plain typing, but only for typing: backspace, the arrows, `^W`, `^U`, `^K` and
history recall all stay at five, and it costs the invariant that `redraw()` is
one unconditional repaint, which is what keeps the editor right across a resize,
a `^L` and the deferred wrap column.

**What is still five is a whole line.** `anchor()` costs seven round trips — two
`cursor_get`s and three `put_styled`s of a `style` and a `write` each, nine when
a failed status adds a fourth colour — and `interactive()` adds a `cwd_get` per
line. That is the Enter-to-next-prompt cost, and it is the next thing anyone
will notice; it is not this change, because it is paid once a line rather than
once a key. *(It was the next thing: "A prompt is one syscall", above, took the
whole line to five.)*

## The shell gets a pid, and `Sys::Fg` gets the rule it meant

Init ran `/bin/sh` from a default-constructed `Executable` and nothing ever
filled `exe.pid` in, so the shell answered to **0** — which is this system's
word for *no pid*. `sched_spawn` returns 0 when it fails, `tty_keys_owner()` and
`tty_screen_owner()` return 0 for "nobody holds it", `SYS_WAIT_ANY` is 0,
`Fg(0)` means "clear the foreground", and `link.pid = 0` is `web/proc.js`'s "no
process in this worker". One process answering to all of that is a collision
waiting for T8, which puts a worker behind that pid for the first time.

The shell now takes **init's** pid, because that is what it is: a process
running inside init's task rather than a job of its own. `main.cpp` passes a
namespace-scope `u32` to `init_task` by reference and fills it in once
`sched_spawn` has said what it is — the same trick `exec.cpp` uses to hand a
stage its pid, and it works for the same reason: a `Task` is lazy, so the body
has not looked yet. Every replacement shell takes that pid again, which is safe
because the record under it is gone first: `~End` calls `proc_remove` and then
`proc_kill`, and `proc_kill` is a bare `host_svc` with nothing to await, so the
host's entry is deleted inside that call rather than a tick later.

`/proc/<init>` grows a `cwd` line as a result, which is right — that job *is*
the shell for all but its first few ticks — and it is what `test/run.mjs` now
asserts before killing the shell, so the literal 2 in that case is justified
rather than assumed.

### What the pid was hiding

`Sys::Fg` refuses a caller that does not own the terminal: *holding the raw
keys, or being in front itself, or nobody being in front*. A shell satisfies
none of those from its second pipeline stage onwards — it lets go of the
keyboard before it spawns (a full-screen child claims the keys in its first
step, so handing them over afterwards is a race the child loses), and by then
stage one is in front. It passed anyway, because `tty_keys_owner()` returned 0
for "nobody" and the shell's pid was also 0. **The check was being satisfied by
a coincidence of sentinels**, and giving the shell a real pid turned `^C` on a
two-stage pipeline into a prompt with a stage still reading.

The repair is the clause the rule was missing: *or what is in front is what you
put there*. The console records who armed the foreground — one `u32`, set when
the set goes from empty and cleared with it — and `console_fg_owner()` is the
fourth clause. That is a rule that says what it means, rather than one inferred
from a keyboard the caller has deliberately let go of. Concept.md §4.3 and
System_Calls.md both say so now.

Nothing had covered it: every `^C` case in the suite was a single-stage command,
and arming stage one is allowed whatever the guard says. `cat | wc` with a `^C`
is the new case, and it fails without the clause.

`console_fg_set` — the array form — went with the change. It had no caller but
its own unit test, left over from when the shell was kernel code, and a second
path into the same state is a second path to keep consistent.

### The replaced shell, covered rather than eyeballed

T7's respawn case proved a replacement appears. It now proves the replacement is
a *whole* shell: its job table is empty and what the dead one backgrounded went
with it, `^C` at its prompt abandons the line, `^C` on a foreground it armed
itself cancels it, and `less` takes and gives back the screen. It also moved
ahead of the two tier-loss cases, so all of that runs at the tier the system
ships rather than at the tier-2 fallback.

Two things about that case are worth knowing before editing it. The shell has to
be killed while a **pipeline** is in front, not a single command: a lone
foreground child clears the console on its way out (`~Report`), while a
pipeline's stages do not — nothing removes one pid from the set, so the shell
clearing it after collecting is the only thing that ever does, and that is
precisely the line the dead shell never reaches. And the `^C` has to be the
**first** thing asked of the replacement, because any command it runs would
clear the stale set on its own way out. Both were found by disabling init's
`console_fg_clear()` and watching the case still pass.

---

## Init replaces a shell that died

The plan's T7, and the design question T8 is waiting on: what happens to
`/bin/sh` when the workers go. **Init starts another shell.** Concept.md §4 says
so now, and this is why.

The question exists because §4's fallback is decided *before* a process starts.
`exec` asks the host for tier 3, the host says it has no worker, and the binary
runs at tier 2 — one isolation weaker, and userland does not notice. That covers
a browser without nested workers and a `procworker.js` that will not load at
boot. It does not cover the tier going away *underneath* a process: the instance
is inside the worker, the worker is terminated, and there is no state to carry
back to tier 2. Every tier-3 process dies there. Today that costs a command.
Once `/bin/sh` is a tier-3 binary it costs the session, because init ran the
shell once and printed *"reload to start again"* when it ended.

### Why the honest answer and not the cheap one

T7 listed three. **Exempting `sh` from `dropWorkers`** is four lines, and it
puts the string `/bin/sh` into `web/proc.js` — a layer that has never known a
program's name, and whose whole discipline is that a pid is bound into a closure
rather than a name being checked. It also answers the wrong half of the
question: the case that actually happens is the shell's *own* worker breaking,
which an exemption does nothing about. **Letting the session end** is defensible
and free, but it makes §4's fallback promise conditional on which program is
asking, and the promise is the reason the fallback is worth having.

So init notices. It is the only place that can: a shell is a process like any
other, and the thing that knows its child ended is its parent.

### Died, not exited — and why a status could not say which

`exec_process` returned an `i32` and nothing else, and an `i32` cannot carry the
distinction. 132 is the kernel's word for a trap and `exit 132` is a program's
word for whatever it likes; a shell that a user typed `exit 130` at and one that
was cancelled are the same number. So the function gained a last defaulted
out-parameter, `bool *died`, set true on entry and false at the one return that
reports a process ending on its own terms. Set that way round deliberately: a
path added later reports a death by default, rather than being silently
forgotten in an enumeration.

The rule init applies is then a sentence rather than a table. **A shell that
exited is final; a shell that died is replaced.** `exit` at the prompt ends the
session exactly as it did — there is no login and no getty, and a prompt
reappearing after `exit` reads as the command having failed. A shell whose
status is 130 is not replaced either: that is the kernel being disposed of, and
a cancelled init would otherwise spend its whole allowance restarting shells
into a kernel that is going away.

The replacement is an ordinary `exec` of `/bin/sh`, which is the load-bearing
part. It asks for whatever tier the binary claims and gets whatever the host can
still give — after a worker that would not load, `workers` is already false and
the new shell is a tier-2 one. Nothing negotiates, nothing is exempt, and §4's
promise comes out true for the shell for the same reason it is true for `wc`.

### Bounded, and why the bound resets

A shell that crashes on its own first step would otherwise announce it for ever.
Three deaths in quick succession and init says the shell will not stay up and
stops. The bound counts *consecutive fast* deaths, though: a shell that lived
longer than a second starts the count again, because a session that has been up
all day should not be one crash away from being unrestartable. Both numbers are
constants at the top of `boot.cpp` and neither is precious.

Two smaller things go with the loop. The `Executable` is resolved on every pass
— its image was moved into the instance, so it cannot be reused, and a `/bin`
repaired since the last shell died is picked up for nothing. And
`console_fg_clear()` runs between shells: a shell that died with a pipeline
armed leaves the console pointing at pids that are gone, and `^C` at the next
prompt would cancel that set instead of abandoning the line being typed. The
keyboard and screen claims need no such help — `~Proc` drops both, and a claim
clears its route only if it is still the holder, which is exactly the rule that
makes a dead claimant safe.

`say()` now starts on a fresh row when the cursor is not at the margin. At boot
it always was; a shell that died left its prompt on that row, and what init has
to say about it is not a continuation of that prompt.

### The bug this found, which would have been the default answer

`dropWorkers()` terminated the worker holding a process and deleted the entry,
and never touched `p.pending` — the step the kernel was waiting on. `kill()` has
always done both, and CLAUDE.md states the rule: a terminated worker's in-flight
step must be failed by whoever killed it. So the *actual* status quo for a
tier-3 shell was not "the session ends" but "the session freezes" — no message,
no prompt, the kernel parked for ever on a reply from a worker that no longer
exists. That is the worst of T7's three answers, and nothing had chosen it.

The fix is one shared helper called by both, so the two ways a worker is taken
away cannot drift again. `dropWorkers` keeps its meaning otherwise: it lets go
of what the host holds and does not set `workers` false, so a host that can
still make workers gets tier 3 back on the next `exec`. Init's replacement shell
converges either way.

`test/run.mjs` has a case for it that fails loudly without the fix — a held
step, then `dropWorkers()`, then the prompt: unfixed, the assertion reports a
blank row where `[1] home $` should be, which is the freeze itself. The respawn
has a case beside it: kill the shell's instance from the host, press a key so it
steps and learns, and assert the `braam: the shell died` line, a fresh prompt,
and a command running on the new shell. It kills pid 0 — init runs the shell
with a default-constructed `Executable`, so that is its pid — and asserts
`live()` before and after, so the case fails rather than quietly testing nothing
if that ever stops being true.

Both cases run at tier 2, since T7 does not move the shell. They will mean more
after T8 and are written to keep working.

---

## The re-measurement, and why T6 is not being written

The plan's T5. T3 put thirty-one programs in workers of their own on the
strength of T1's figures; T5 is the gate on the other side of that, and it
decides one thing — whether to spend a week on T6, which is either a bigger
`SYS_CHUNK` or a batched step protocol. **No.** The prompt costs 0.09–0.42 ms a
key under sustained typing and bulk I/O costs 10–13 ms more than tier 2 on the
largest workload in the suite, which are T5's own two conditions for skipping
it. The figures are at the top of this file; this is why they mean that.

### The harness had lost its control, which is the whole of the code change

T1's three arms were `bundle.bin` (every program at tier 2, as it shipped then)
and two re-stamped twins. T3 inverted the default, so `bundle.bin` became the
tier-3-but-for-`sh` archive — which is what `bundle3nosh.bin` already was. The
two files were byte-identical, verifiable with `shasum`, and the harness was
measuring one configuration twice and the genuine tier-2 case not at all.

So the `bench` target packs `bundle2.bin` — every program stamped `--tier 2`,
`sh` included — and no longer packs `bundle3nosh.bin`, whose job `bundle.bin`
now does. The staging directories are `tier2` and `tier3` rather than `all` and
`nosh`, which named a distinction that no longer exists.

The three arm *ids* were left alone deliberately: `t2` means every program at
tier 2 exactly as it did at T1, `t3nosh` means tier 3 but for the shell, `t3`
means all of it. Only the file behind two of them changed. That is what lets
T5's tables be read straight against T1's, and it is worth more than a tidier
name — a benchmark whose arms silently change meaning between runs is worse than
no benchmark, which is precisely the failure this change repairs.

### What the numbers say that T1's could not

T1 could not separate the tier's cost from the shell's, because its tier-2 arm
was also its tier-2-shell arm. With a real control the two come apart:

- **The prompt is the tier-2 control's prompt, to the clock, in all three
  engines.** As shipped a keystroke echoes in 0.20 ms under Blink and under the
  1 ms clock step in Gecko and WebKit, and 64 keys back to back cost 0.09–0.42
  ms each with nothing dropped. T1's frightening figures — 2.7 ms a key in
  Gecko, 5.1 in WebKit — were never the shipped system's. They belong to the arm
  with the shell at tier 3, where the re-run made WebKit worse still at 6.2 ms.
  That is T7 and T8's problem, and T5 sharpens rather than softens it.
- **A round trip is unchanged at 34–45 µs.** Nothing about putting thirty-one
  programs in workers made the per-call cost move, which is the result a cost
  model should give and is worth recording as a null.
- **T2's pool sizing bought 4–8 ms on a pipeline, in every engine.**
  `cat | cat | wc` fell from 25.6 to 19.7 ms in Blink, 30 to 26 in Gecko, 27 to
  19 in WebKit, and its counters went from `hired 1, reused 2, terminated 1` to
  `hired 0, reused 3, terminated 0` everywhere. The per-round-trip cost did not
  move, so all of that is the worker start T2 stopped paying — a cheaper win
  than T6 proposed, taken before T6 was decided.
- **T1's every-64th `setTimeout(drain, 0)` finding retired itself.** It was the
  larger half of a bulk command's cost at tier 2 — 9.5 ms of 16.6 in Blink, 18.5
  of 33 in Gecko. As shipped, `wc` over eight files takes that route **zero**
  times, because the only tier-2 process left is the shell and it takes 21 steps
  rather than 483. T2 deferred the item on the grounds that it wanted its own
  measurement; this is that measurement, and it says the item shrank to the
  shell's own stepping. It is also why Gecko's shipped figure beats its tier-2
  control outright.

### Why "acceptable" rather than a threshold

T5's criterion is a judgement and should be written down as one. 10–13 ms on a
quarter of a megabyte through three processes is under a frame for a command
nobody waits on interactively, and nothing in `src/cmd/` moves more data than
that. The honest statement of the decision is therefore not "the cost is small"
but "nothing we have written can perceive it", and the thing that would reopen
T6 is a workload rather than a figure — something moving megabytes, where 34–45
µs per 512 bytes is 70–90 ms each.

Recording that distinction is the point of skipping T6 in writing rather than by
silence.

---

## Every program in a worker of its own

The plan's T3 and T4. Thirty-one of the thirty-two binaries in `/bin` now ask
for tier 3, and `/bin/sh` is the one that asks for tier 2. So every command a
user can start is a process the system can *kill* rather than one it can only
ask to stop — which is what tier 3 buys and the only thing it buys (§4.2).

Nothing in C++ moved for it. The tier is a `u32` in a binary's `braam` custom
section and §4.3's promise is that the same binary runs at either, so this
change is an argument to `stamp.py`, a map in `test/run.mjs`, and the documents
it made false. `bundle.bin` is the same size to the byte: the section is
fixed-width, and re-stamping rewrites a field rather than adding one.

### Why now, and why by default

§4.4 estimated a tier-3 syscall at "order 0.1 ms" and concluded that the tier
had to be *"a claim a binary makes rather than a default"*. T1 measured it at
**34–44 µs** in three engines. That is the whole argument: at a tenth of the
estimate, a command that reads a file or filters a stream pays a few hundred
microseconds for isolation it cannot be talked out of, and the only program in
the system that cannot afford it is the one being typed into — a keystroke costs
six syscalls, and T1 measured sustained typing at 2.7 ms a key in Gecko and 5.1
in WebKit with the shell at tier 3. So the default inverted and the shell is the
exception, rather than the other way about.

The default lives in `cmake/BraamProgram.cmake`, which is the recipe the SDK
installs, so an out-of-tree program gets what the system's own programs get. T3
had said to leave that until T8 on the grounds that the SDK's default is a claim
about what a *stranger's* program should ask for — and it is, which is why it
should be the same claim. A program that wants tier 2 says `TIER 2` and gives up
the kill; `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt` has exactly one such line, for `sh`.

`src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt` lost its per-program tier loop with it. An undefined
`BRAAM_BIN_TIER_<p>` now expands to nothing and the recipe's default applies,
which is how `BRAAM_BIN_LIB_<p>` had always worked.

### What the tests had to learn

The driver pumps both tiers uniformly, so most of `test/run.mjs` held unedited —
including the cases that matter most: a tier-3 `timeout` supervising a tier-3
`spin`, `watch` piping to a child, and `^C` down a chain of two workers. Four
things did not.

**The pool counts changed, and what they mean is worth more than the numbers.**
`pooled()` is 1 after the first `spin 1` and 2 before `timeout 20 spin`, where
before it was the two hired at boot, untouched. The rule they now assert is that
the pool grows only for a pipeline wider than what is idle and shrinks only when
a process is *killed*, so each number is hires less terminations — 8 less 7, and
13 less 11 — and is a running record of what the session has killed. They stay
exact literals; an "at least one" would have stopped testing the pool.

**`net.hold()` had to learn to count.** It held "the next process to bind a
worker", which was unambiguous while two programs took one. It is not now: a
`submit("clear", …)` between the hold and the command takes it instead — `clear`
is a program, not a builtin — and in `timeout 20 spin` the parent binds its own
worker before the child that never returns. `net.hold(n)` holds the *n*-th bind
from there. The alternative was putting the binary's path into the `bind`
message so a test could hold by name, which is a change to the host protocol for
a test's convenience.

**The broken-worker case was clearing the screen with the broken worker.**
`clear` was the first `exec` after `dropWorkers()`, so it crashed in `spin`'s
place and gave the tier up before the case under test ran. The clear happens
before the tier is broken now.

**The two cases that give the tier up moved to the end of the run.** Neither can
be undone — `workers` stays false for the session, by design — so everything
after them ran at tier 2 while shipping at tier 3, and after this change that
"everything" was the whole `/bin/sh`-as-a-program section: a shell process
spawning pipelines, `less` claiming the screen and losing it to `^C`. They now
sit just before the final `exit 7`, and that section runs at the tier it ships
at.

### What this does not fix, and what it costs

The two §4.3 fidelity losses stop being true of two programs and become true of
all of them. A binary that will not instantiate reads as a crash (132) rather
than as a refusal (126), because a tier-3 instance is created inside its worker
— so a spawn that runs out of memory on a loaded page reports a crash. And
`Sys::Now` is relative: nothing calls `proc_now()` today, so that is a
constraint on what may be written next rather than a regression.

Bulk I/O is where the cost lands: a syscall per `SYS_CHUNK`, which is 512 bytes,
at 34–44 µs each. T5 is the re-measurement that decides whether T6 — a bigger
chunk, or batched replies — is worth starting. It has since been taken, and the
answer is no; the note above this one has it.

The shell is untouched and stays at tier 2. T7 is the design question that has
to be answered before it moves — a tier-3 shell dies with the workers, and
nothing re-execs init.

---

## A pool for a system where every command needs a worker

The plan's T2. The pool in `web/proc.js` was sized for the two tier-3 binaries
that exist — `MAX_IDLE` 2, one worker hired at boot — and T1 measured what that
costs the moment a pipeline is at the tier: `cat /bin/sh | cat | wc` **hires one
worker and terminates one on every run**, in all three engines, while reusing
two. Three stages want three workers at once and the pool holds two, so the
third is bought and thrown away each time. `MAX_IDLE` is now 4 and two workers
are hired at boot.

### The number is a pipeline, and the cap stays a cap

The pool only ever fills by *returning* what it hired on demand, so it
self-tunes up to the peak concurrency a session reaches and `MAX_IDLE` is the
point where it stops. Four is a four-stage pipeline's worth held with nothing
running — one more than the three stages T1 measured, and once the shell is a
tier-3 process (T8) it holds one of its own besides, outside the pool.

`pool()`'s terminate-vs-keep rule was the other thing T2 asked to re-decide, and
it keeps its shape. An unbounded pool is the obvious alternative and is wrong
for the reason the cap was written: a twenty-stage pipeline would leave twenty
threads behind for a session that will never want them again. What was wrong was
the number, not the rule.

The pre-hire is two rather than four because it is only about the *first*
command: a `Worker` constructor returns before its script has loaded, so what a
pre-hire buys is that the load has finished by the time something is bound into
it. Two is the shell's and the first command's, and the pool reaches four by
itself on the first pipeline that wants four.

### An idle worker was holding a dead process's memory

`MAX_IDLE` 4 made a comment worth checking, and it was false at tier 3.
`serveProc` dropped its instance at the *next* bind, so a pooled worker pinned
the finished process's `WebAssembly.Memory` — as much as `PROC_MAX_PAGES`, 16 MB
— until it was hired again, and four idle workers would have pinned four of
them. The instance and its memory are now released on the step that ends the
process, in `serveProc.step` where the trap path already did it, so it is one
place and both tiers. At tier 2 it changes nothing observable: `retire()` drops
the whole server a moment later.

### The probe's question is about the script, not about what is running

`broke()` ended with `if (!idle.length && !procs.size) workers = false`, which
is how a host whose `procworker.js` will not load was supposed to stop trying.
It cannot fire once a tier-3 process is permanent: with the shell at the tier,
`procs` is never empty again, and every `exec` would hire another worker that
will never load.

The replacement asks the question the latch was really asking. Each link records
whether it announced itself — the `{ k: "ready" }` message `deliver()` had been
dropping on the floor, whose comment already said it "says the worker loaded,
and nothing more" — and `broke()` gives the tier up only for a worker that broke
before saying so. One that had loaded and then threw is a process that crashed,
which is its own business and no reason to disable the tier for the session. The
distinction is exact rather than heuristic: `onerror` before `ready` *is* a
script that would not evaluate, and the ordering holds because `ready` is posted
during evaluation.

`test/fakeworker.mjs` gained the switch that models it — `net.broken` makes a
link that serves nothing and reports an error where a real one would — because
nothing in the suite had ever called `link.onerror`, and a latch with no test is
a latch that was wrong twice.

### What was deliberately not done here

T1's other finding, that tier 2's bulk cost is mostly the every-64th
`setTimeout(drain, 0)` in `web/worker.js` rather than the call itself, is
untouched. It is a change to how the kernel worker yields and it wants its own
measurement; sizing the pool does not depend on it.

## What a syscall costs, measured

The plan proposes moving every program to tier 3, and its first item, T1, is the
gate: the whole argument for the change is the cost of a syscall, and nobody had
measured one. Concept.md §4.4 asserts *"two `postMessage` hops and two copies,
order 0.1 ms"* and the M9 note repeats it, but both were estimates —
`test/run.mjs` counts ticks rather than wall time, and its links have no thread
in them. The answer is **34–44 µs** for a tier-3 round trip and **0.2–2.9 ms**
added to a keystroke, which is two to three times better than the guess in one
place and worse than it looks in another. The figures are at the top of this
file; this is why they are the ones that were taken.

### The measurement is a difference, not a stopwatch

Timing one syscall would have needed a boundary to argue about — does the span
start when the process calls `sys_async`, or when the kernel's job is scheduled?
— and it could not have been read anyway: without cross-origin isolation
`performance.now()` steps in 0.1 ms under Blink and a whole millisecond under
Gecko and WebKit, and `PROC_TASKS` is 8, so several round trips overlap and
their mean is not a per-call cost.

So the number is ΔT/ΔN over two runs of the *same command*: `wc` over one file
against `wc` over eight. Same binary, same spawn, same compile-cache hit, same
instantiate, same exit, same prompt redraw — all of it subtracts out, and what
is left is the marginal cost of a round trip. ΔN is read out of counters rather
than predicted, which is what makes it a measurement and not arithmetic about
`SYS_CHUNK`.

The eight files have to be eight *different* files. `wc /bin/sh /bin/sh` is
`Err(Perm)`: §5.2 gives one open per path system-wide, because an OPFS sync
access handle takes an exclusive lock and the open-file table enforces that for
every backend rather than only the one it came from. That cost half an hour and
is worth writing down.

### The tier-2 number is mostly a timer

The result that changes what T2 should do first: **tier 2's marginal cost is not
a call.** Every 64th tier-2 step is scheduled with `setTimeout(drain, 0)` rather
than a microtask — `web/worker.js` does that so a process in a tight syscall
loop cannot chain microtasks without the worker ever painting — and one of those
waits 1.3 ms in Blink, 2.4 ms in Gecko, 0.25 ms in WebKit. `wc` over eight files
takes that route eight times, which is 10.2 ms of a 16.2 ms command in Blink and
19 of 33 in Gecko. Discount it and a tier-2 round trip is 2–17 µs.

That is why the tiers look nearly equal in the raw figures, and in Gecko it is
why tier 3 measures *faster* than tier 2 for bulk I/O. The every-64th rule is a
cheaper thing to reconsider than T6's `SYS_CHUNK` or a batched step protocol,
and it was invisible until something counted the two routes separately.

### A keystroke has two answers, and only one of them is reassuring

A repaint is four syscalls, and the first of them damages the grid — so
key-to-first-paint and key-to-finished-echo are different numbers. Under Blink
they are within a factor of four; under Gecko the second is thirty times the
first. Reporting either alone would have been misleading, so the harness reports
both, and the headline is the echo.

One key is inside a frame at either tier in every engine. **Sustained typing is
not**: 64 keys back to back cost 0.34 ms each at tier 3 in Blink but 2.7 in
Gecko and 5.1 in WebKit, against 0.10 to 0.42 at tier 2. Nothing was dropped —
the 64-slot ring held — but a shell that costs 5 ms a keystroke while it is
being typed into is the thing T7 and T8 have to answer to, and it is engine
dependent in a way the bulk figure is not.

The third arm exists to make that attributable. It stamps every binary tier 3
*except* `sh`, and its keystroke figures match the stock archive's in all three
engines: the keystroke cost is the shell's own tier, not the programs'.

### Why a re-stamped twin rather than a rebuild

The tier is six u32s in a `braam` custom section and `stamp.py` strips a prior
one before appending, so the twin archives are the same binaries with one word
changed — `cmake --build build --target bench` copies the staging tree,
re-stamps, and repacks. Nothing is recompiled, `bundle.bin` is byte-identical,
and the three CTest cases never see the twins because they take their inputs by
explicit path. A second build tree would have measured a second build.

### The counters are unconditional, and the clock is in the worker

Gating the instrumentation behind an option would have meant measuring a build
nobody runs. What it costs is a dozen integer increments on paths that already
do a `postMessage`, one bounded ring of key samples, and a `stats()` on what
`makeProc` returns. `workers` is in there because it cannot be inferred: with it
false a tier-3 binary ran at tier 2, and the arm measured tier 2 twice.

The first version timed from the page and had a 14 ms floor — two poll intervals
— which is larger than most of the workloads. The fix was to stamp both ends in
the worker, at the key and at the repaint, and let the page poll only for
*whether* it is over. A poll costs a message; it should not also cost the
measurement.

### What the harness had to survive

Three failures, none of them about tiers, each of which would otherwise have
read as a hang:

- **A background tab throttles the timers being measured**, so the page refuses
  to start hidden and marks any pass that loses focus. Per pass, not per
  session: eight minutes of six page loads with a person at the machine will
  lose focus once, and that is no reason to discard the other five.
- **WebKit will not boot a second kernel promptly in the same document**, and
  will not boot the next one at all while the last one's worker still holds its
  OPFS handles. One arm per page load, two seconds after `dispose()`, and a
  retry that reloads the same pass.
- **An unanswered `selectall` is indistinguishable from a blank screen**, since
  `deselect()` posts a selection nobody asked for. `selectall` now carries the
  asker's id back and answers even with nothing to answer with.

`tools/bench.mjs` prints the page's progress as it arrives, which is how the
last two were found: a browser whose console nobody is reading is the normal
case here, and a run that stops has to say where.

---

## An SDK after all

"Plain clang, and no SDK" below is about the *toolchain* — that nothing is taken
from a distribution but the compiler. This is the other sense of the word, and
it was missing: there was no way to write a program for Braam without being
inside this repository. The recipe that turns `echo.cpp` into `/bin/echo` was an
inline `foreach` body in `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt`, the include path was
`${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src`, and there was no `install()` anywhere in the tree.

Nothing about the system required that. `exec_resolve` reads an image through
the ordinary VFS against the caller's working directory, and `exec_meta` accepts
anything with a well-formed stamp at the current `PROC_ABI` — so a `.wasm` that
arrives at runtime, through `import` or down a `curl`, is already a command.
What was missing was only the means to produce one. `make install` and
`braam-sdk-<version>.zip` are that means, and the whole of it is headers, two
static libraries, a CMake package and `stamp.py`.

### One recipe, not a copy of it

`braam_add_program()` in `cmake/BraamProgram.cmake` is the old loop body, moved.
`src/cmd/` calls it for all thirty-two programs and the SDK installs the same
file, so an out-of-tree program is built by the same code rather than by a
description of it that can fall behind. The one thing the in-tree call site
still adds is the tier map; the one thing it lost is the per-binary size budget,
removed separately.

That refactor is verifiable in a way a rewritten recipe would not be:
`hello.wasm` built out of tree against an unpacked archive is byte-identical to
the same file built in tree.

### What is installed, and what is not

`braam_proc` and `braam_ui`, and no more. `braam_core`, `braam_fs`, `braam_svc`
and `braam_user` each carry a host import, and `test/run.mjs` asserts that no
binary imports anything but `env.memory`, `kernel.sys` and `kernel.sys_async` —
so shipping them would offer a consumer a link that produces a binary the kernel
refuses to run.

Headers go to `include/braam/` rather than `include/`, because the directories
under them are `kernel/`, `fs/`, `proc/` and `ui/`, and those cannot be dropped
into `/usr/local/include`. Whole directories are installed rather than the
include closure of `proc/io.h`: the closure is a list, and a list would fall
behind. Layout inside is load bearing — an include within a directory is a bare
name — so the four keep their shape and the SDK's single `-I` is
`include/braam`.

The paths are fixed rather than `GNUInstallDirs`, because the same tree is
zipped and unpacked anywhere and the package finds itself by walking up from
`lib/cmake/braam`; a distribution that said `lib64` would break that walk for no
gain.

### Three things that only bite out of tree

The interesting part of the work was not the `install()` rules; it was
discovering what the project had been supplying to its own targets without
saying so.

**The C++ standard.** `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20` is a project setting, so a
consumer got the compiler's default and failed inside `task.h`, where `Task` is
a coroutine type. It is now
`target_compile_features(braam_flags INTERFACE cxx_std_20)`: a property of the
headers, which is what it always was.

**The build type.** Freestanding, an unoptimised build does not link —
`__builtin_strlen` on a literal and an outlined `memcpy` become calls to
functions nothing provides. In tree that was invisible because the root
defaulted `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `MinSizeRel`. The default moved into the
toolchain file, where it applies to everyone who uses the toolchain, and it is a
`CACHE` entry without `FORCE` so `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=` from the command line
still wins.

**`-Werror`.** Inherited from an installed interface it is hostile: a consumer's
code would be held to this tree's warning policy by a library it linked. It is
now `$<BUILD_INTERFACE:-Werror>`, so the tree stays warning-clean and the SDK
stays polite.

There is a fourth, smaller: `find_package(braam)` cannot search under
`CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY` with no root path. Rather than invent a
root, the installed toolchain file sets `braam_DIR` to its own directory when
`braamConfig.cmake` sits beside it — which is true of the installed copy and
false of the one in the source tree, so one file serves both.

### Forgetting the toolchain file

The one thing a consumer must supply is the toolchain, and it cannot be supplied
late: CMake picks the compiler at the first `project()`, so a build tree
configured without it holds the host's `c++` and there is no flag that repairs
it. What that looked like was a page of errors from the headers —
`sizeof(usize) == 4, "wasm32"`, then `unknown type name '__externref_t'` — which
name the symptom and not the cause.

`braamConfig.cmake` now refuses a build tree whose processor is not `wasm32`,
and says which compiler it found, that the directory has to be deleted rather
than fixed, and the exact `cmake -B build --toolchain <path>` to run — with the
path filled in, since the config knows where it is. The same line is printed by
`make install` at the end. Detecting it is all that is possible: a package
config runs after `project()`, so by the time it is read the compiler has been
chosen and the only useful thing left is a sentence.

The check mirrors the guard at the top of the root `CMakeLists.txt`, which has
refused the same mistake for the project's own build since M0.

### `stamp.py --sysabi`

The stamp carries the process ABI, and `stamp.py` reads `PROC_ABI` out of
`sysabi.h` rather than restating it — that is what makes a stale binary say
`built for another process ABI` instead of crashing. The installed copy has no
`src/` tree to read, so the header is named on the command line and the recipe
always passes it. The alternative, baking the number into the installed script,
would have reintroduced exactly the copy the original design avoided.

### An example that cannot rot

`examples/hello/` is installed as the worked example *and* built by the ordinary
build, from one `CMakeLists.txt` that finds the SDK only if the targets are not
already defined. A sample that is not compiled is a sample that is wrong within
a few commits.

What this does not do is prove the *installed* tree is complete — that would
take a test that installs to a temporary prefix and builds against it, which is
a nested configure on every `make run`. The judgement was that the example's
in-tree build catches source rot, which is frequent, and that install rules
change rarely enough to check by hand at release time.

### Two archives

`make release` now emits `braam-sdk-<version>.zip` beside the site's. A
directory inside the site archive was the alternative and was rejected: the site
is what a web root serves, and an install tree is not part of it. The SDK
archive is staged by installing into `build/sdk`, so the zip and `make install`
cannot disagree about what the SDK is, and `release.py` grew only `--name` and
`--require` to describe a tree that is not a site.

## No budget for a program

The per-binary lines in `tools/size_budget.txt` are gone, along with the
POST_BUILD check behind them. What they were for was making §4.4's duplication
visible — every binary carries its own allocator, string types and coroutine
runtime — but `bundle.bin` already shows that in one number, and it is the
number that matters, since the archive is awaited before the first prompt. (That
number is the staging tree's now: see "One store, and rootfs.zip".) Thirty-two
limits underneath it caught nothing the archive's own limit would not, and each
was a line to edit whenever a program legitimately grew.

Two entries remain, `kernel.wasm` and `bundle.bin`. CI still reports every
binary's size into the job summary, now with `--report`, under which a file with
no budget is printed rather than refused: measured, not bounded.

## Plain clang, and no SDK

wasi-sdk is gone from the build. It was never used as an SDK — §3.1 has said
from M0 that the toolchain is a compiler and nothing else,
`-nostdlib -nostdinc++` being the whole of the relationship — so what it
actually contributed was a pinned tarball for CI, downloaded and cached on every
run, and a config file we had to pass `--no-default-config` to suppress. That is
a hundred megabytes and a cache key to obtain a clang that Debian ships as
`clang`.

CI now runs `apt-get install clang lld llvm clang-format` and builds with no
configure flags at all: the toolchain file finds the tools itself. The pin was
worth something — a tarball cannot drift under an upgrade the way a rolling keg
can — but what it was insuring against is a compiler that miscompiles a
freestanding wasm module, and against that a version the distribution tests is
at least as good a bet as one nobody else builds this way.

The toolchain file stopped composing paths out of a prefix and started calling
`find_program` for each of clang, clang++, llvm-ar, llvm-ranlib and wasm-ld, so
`BRAAM_LLVM` became a hint rather than the answer. Homebrew is why the hint
survives at all: its llvm keg is not on PATH, so `/usr/local/opt/llvm` and
`/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm` are still probed first, while its `lld` is, which is
exactly the split the old code special-cased for `wasm-ld` alone. Every tool is
now checked the same way and a missing one is named at configure time.
`BRAAM_WASI_SDK`, the alias kept for a rename two milestones ago, went with it.

The formatting check left CI altogether, because it turned out to be a check on
the *version* of clang-format as much as on the tree: Debian's is older than
Homebrew's, and three places in `curl.cpp` and `main.cpp` were formatted the way
only the newer one formats them. `.clang-format` is still authoritative and
those three are now written the way both versions agree on — one of them a line
over the 100-column limit that the newer clang-format declines to break — but
which clang-format a contributor happens to have is no longer a way to fail the
build.

`--no-default-config` stays. Its justification was wasi-sdk's `clang++.cfg`, but
any distribution may ship one, and a sysroot injected behind the flags is
exactly the failure the flag makes impossible.

### The wasm features are named now

The first CI run on Debian's clang 18 failed on
`unknown type name '__externref_t'`, which is what clang says when
reference-types is off. It had never been off: every clang the build had seen
was new enough to have it in the default CPU. That default is not a stable thing
to build on — the feature set `generic` implies has moved twice in recent
releases — so the toolchain file now names what it needs,
`-mreference-types -mbulk-memory -msign-ext -mmutable-globals -mnontrapping-fptoint`,
and the code compiles the same on clang 18 as on clang 22.

Two of those are load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Without reference-types the
externref table of §3.7 cannot be declared at all. Without bulk-memory, LLVM
stops lowering `memcpy` and `memset` inline and emits calls instead, which is a
link error rather than a silent libc dependency — correct behaviour, thanks to
`--allow-undefined` being gone, but a puzzling one to debug.

The list was checked by building with `-mcpu=mvp` in front of it: nothing in the
tree needs a feature that is enabled only by a modern default. `kernel.wasm`
came out 12 bytes smaller that way, which is the measure of how little the rest
of the default set is worth here.

## The Linux console's sixteen colours

`web/render.js` shipped a palette of nobody's in particular — a softened set
picked to look pleasant against its own background. It is the Linux console's
now: `#AA1111` red, `#11AA11` green, `#AA5511` for the brown that a 16-colour
palette calls yellow, `#AAAAAA` for white, and the `#55` / `#FF` bright half
above them.

The reason is that the indices are the interface. §2.3 puts a palette index in
the cell rather than a colour, so `COLOR_YELLOW` in a program's `style_set`
means whatever the page decides — and a program written against a terminal has
forty years of expectation about what index 3 looks like. A palette that renders
3 as a pale gold rather than a brown makes `COLOR_YELLOW` a surprise, and the
tests, which read indices, cannot see the difference. Matching the console
removes the question.

The one departure is the floor: the console's `#00` channel is `#11` here, so
black is `#111111` and the dark half is mixed from `11` rather than `00`. A
canvas is not a CRT and true black on a backlit panel reads as a hole in the
page rather than as the absence of light. It is the one value `web/index.html`
was already built around, so the page's background is unchanged and only its
text moved, to `#AAAAAA` — index 7 — with the error line on bright red, so the
frame and the grid are the same terminal rather than two nearly-equal greys.

`web/embed.html`'s amber palette is untouched: it exists to show that a palette
is an embedder's choice, and it is the only thing proving the `options.palette`
path still works.

---

## A prompt that says where you are

The prompt now names the working directory: the basename, plain white on blue,
then a space and the bright white `$`.

```
home $ _
```

It cost no operation. `Sys::Style` was already there for the red `[N]`, and
`Sys::Chdir` already answers "where am I" — the shell asks the same question
`pwd` does, through the same call. The change is a third run in `anchor` and a
third field in `Prompt`, and the wasm ABI, the import list, the export list and
the §4.3 table are all exactly as they were.

**The basename, not the path.** The terminal is 80 columns at its widest and a
prompt that grows with the depth of the tree eats the line being typed — and the
line editor anchors on wherever the prompt ended, so a long one is not wrong,
only cramped. The basename is what actually answers the question a prompt is
asked. `path_basename` already returns `/` for the root, which is the one case
where a bare name would have been empty, so the root reads `/ $` with no special
case written for it.

**Asked every prompt, not remembered.** The obvious optimisation is for `cd` to
stash what `cwd_set` hands back — it already gets the resulting absolute path
and throws it away. It was not done. `cd` being the only thing that moves the
shell is true today and is not a property anything enforces; a cached prompt
would go quietly stale the first time something else moved it, and staleness in
a prompt is worse than a syscall, because a wrong prompt is believed. One
`Sys::Chdir` per *line* is a park and a step against the six ticks a single
keystroke already costs (§4.4), so it is not on any path that matters.

**The space is outside the colour.** Three runs, not two: the directory on blue,
then `" $ "` on black. Putting the space inside the coloured run would have been
one fewer `String` and a blue block that runs one cell past the name, which
reads as a trailing space in a highlight rather than as a separator. So the
separator lives at the head of the bright white run, and the shell picks `"$ "`
or `" $ "` depending on whether there is a directory to separate from — which is
also the whole of the fallback: a `Sys::Chdir` that fails leaves the prompt
exactly as it was before this change rather than leaving a hole where a name
should be.

**Two things about it are lifetime, not taste.** `Prompt` holds non-owning
`Str`s and always has; until now every one of them pointed at a literal, and
`dir` points into a `String` the loop body owns. That `String` must outlive the
`read_line` that draws it — including the `^L` path, which re-runs `anchor` with
the same `Prompt` — which is why it is declared in the loop body and not built
into the call. `path_basename` returns a `Str` *into its argument*, so the two
are one lifetime, not two.

The second is a trap worth naming: `dir.empty() ? "$ " : " $ "` does not compile
against a freestanding target. `Str`'s `const char *` constructor is
`__builtin_strlen`, which folds for a literal and does not fold for a pointer
chosen at run time — so the ternary emits a call to `strlen`, and
`--allow-undefined` is deliberately absent (§C.3), so the link fails rather than
the program. `"$ "_s` is the fix: the `operator""_s` in `str.h` is the sized
constructor, and the choice happens between two finished `Str`s.

**The smoke test now builds the prompt rather than spelling it.** Thirty-odd
assertions compared the cursor row against `"$"` or `"[130] $"`, and the suite
`cd`s half a dozen times, so the expected text is no longer constant. It tracks
the directory it is in and a `prompt(status)` helper composes what should be on
the row — which is a stronger assertion than the literal was, since it now also
says the shell is where the test thinks it is. The colour checks got the same
treatment: they were "column 0 is bright white", and they are now "the name is
white on blue, the space after it is not, and the `$` is bright white", which is
the thing the change is about.

## Telling a CORS refusal from a dead network

M6 gave `curl` one hint on `Error::Io` — "a cross-origin URL needs CORS" —
because `fetch` reports a refused origin and an unreachable server identically,
as a `TypeError` with nothing in it. The hint was right most of the time and
wrong in the one case where a user most needs to be believed: when the network
really is broken, the message sent them looking at a header their server may
already send.

The two can be told apart, and the browser will do it. A `no-cors` request is
not blocked — it goes out, the server answers, and what comes back is an opaque
`Response` with status `0` and no body. Useless to read, which is why braam
cannot use it for the fetch itself, and conclusive as a probe: only a reachable
server resolves it at all. `web/svc.js` runs one when, and only when, the real
fetch has already rejected, and reports `Error::Perm` if it succeeds and
`Error::Io` if it does not. The probe is aborted the moment it resolves, since
`fetch` settles on the response headers and the body would otherwise be
downloaded for nothing.

`Perm` is the right existing error rather than a new one. What happened is
precisely a permission denied: the request was made, the server answered, and
the browser would not let the page read the reply. Adding an `Error::Cors` would
have put a browser's vocabulary into a kernel enum that storage and the
filesystem share, for a distinction one program makes — and it would have been
an ABI change in `abi.js` and `result.h` for a diagnostic.

So `curl` now says "response is not accessible because the server did not grant
cross-origin access" for one and "no answer" for the other, and neither can be
mistaken for the other's cause. The first says what happened rather than naming
the header, at the cost of wrapping on a 60-column grid; the second is short
because there is nothing more to say.

The fake carries the same distinction: a route in `test/fakesvc.mjs` may name
the error it fails with, so `test/run.mjs` drives both paths without a network.
What it cannot cover is the probe itself — there is no CORS in Node and `mode`
is ignored there, so the fake asserts what the kernel and `curl` do with each
answer, not how `web/svc.js` arrives at it. That is the same gap every service
has against a fake, and the same reason `tools/wsd.mjs` exists for the one where
it mattered more.

None of this makes a cross-origin fetch work. It cannot: the same-origin policy
is what stops a page reading a reply that carries the user's cookies, and no
flag, API or permission prompt lifts it. A relay would, at the cost of the
server braam is built not to need. The change is to the diagnosis alone, which
is the part that was fixable.

## Paste, as typing

`Cmd+V` — `Ctrl+V` where that is the chord — puts the clipboard into the
terminal. It cost one function in `web/keys.js`, a feeder in `web/worker.js`,
four lines in `web/braam.js` and a return value on `key()`. Nothing else moved:
no import, no export added, no syscall, and no operation in the §4.3 table.

**A paste is keystrokes.** §2.3 leaves no alternative — the terminal is a cell
grid and the keyboard is a `Channel<Key>`, so there is no stream for pasted text
to be written into and no second way in for it to take. `pasted(text)` turns the
text into the run of key codes that would have typed it: `Enter` for a newline
however the platform spells it (`\r\n` and `\r` are one `Enter`, not two), `Tab`
for a tab, and nothing for any other control character, because there is no key
that produces one. The reward for that translation is that everything downstream
already works — the line editor, a cooked reader like `cat`, and a raw claimant
like `edit` each get a paste on the terms they already read keys on, and none of
them can tell it from fast typing.

**Why `key()` now returns something.** The keyboard ring holds 64 keystrokes and
drops what it cannot hold — the right policy for a keyboard, and the wrong one
for a paste, which is routinely longer than the ring and would arrive with its
tail cut off. The host has to feed the run at the rate the console drains it,
and to do that it has to know when the ring is full. Nothing else tells it:
occupancy is not in the `Screen` descriptor, `tick`'s delay says nothing about
it, and a fixed chunk size per turn is a guess that is silently wrong when a raw
claimant is slow to read.

So `key()` reports whether it queued the keystroke, and `web/worker.js` pushes
until it is refused, ticks, and comes back on a later turn for the rest. This is
the smallest change that makes the loss impossible rather than unlikely, and it
does not weaken §2.2: the return value is a fact about the call the host just
made, not a result arriving from the kernel — no data crosses and nothing is
scheduled. The alternatives were worse in kind, not degree. A `paste(ptr, len)`
export would be a seventh entry on the boundary and a byte stream into the
keyboard, which is the invariant inverted. Growing the ring to fit the largest
plausible paste is a number that is always too small or always too large, and it
would still drop the paste after it.

A second paste while one is being fed joins the queue rather than displacing it,
for the reason `pbpaste`'s superseded waiter answers empty: a run that is
silently truncated in the middle is worse than one that arrives late. A key
*typed* during a paste goes straight in ahead of the rest of the run — `^C` must
not wait behind a hundred queued keystrokes.

**Who gets the gesture.** Neither `Ctrl+V` nor `Cmd+V` is prevented, which is
deliberate and was already true: the `paste` event the browser makes from them
is the only way a page may read the clipboard with no permission, which is what
`pbpaste` is built on (§5.4). The event is the document's rather than the
canvas's, so the focus decides first — an embedded terminal must not swallow a
paste meant for a field beside it. That gate is new for `pbpaste` too, and it is
a fix rather than a side effect: its waiter was global, so once a paste could be
typed, an unfocused terminal with `pbpaste` running would have taken one meant
for the terminal next to it. Within the focused terminal a waiting `pbpaste`
wins and nothing is typed — it asked for exactly this gesture, and a program
reading the clipboard wants the text rather than the keystrokes.

**What it does not fix.** A multi-line paste at the prompt loses everything
after the first command's newline, and that is type-ahead across a command
boundary rather than anything about pasting. The shell claims the raw route to
edit a line and gives it back around anything it runs (§3.5), so keystrokes
arriving while a command runs are *cooked* — echoed, and put in the console
channel as that command's stdin, which is what makes `cat` read what is typed.
The shell's line editor never reads that channel, and `console_fg_set` clears it
when the next command is armed. Handing the leftover cooked input to the editor
when it retakes the keys is the fix, and it is a change to the console
discipline rather than to the paste: a non-blocking read of the console channel,
and a rule for what a partial line means when the claim moves. Pasting one line
— a command, a path, a URL — is the case that motivated this and it is exact.

`test/run.mjs` feeds a pasted line longer than the ring with the same loop
`web/worker.js` uses and asserts both that the whole run arrives and that it
took more than one turn, so a ring that silently grew or a `key()` that stopped
reporting would show up as a test that no longer proves anything.

## A prompt with a colour

The prompt is bright white, and the `[N]` in front of it — the status of the
command that just failed — is red. That is two lines of taste and one operation
in the §4.3 table: `Sys::Style` at 70, which makes the table thirty-five and
`PROC_ABI` 5.

**Why it needed an operation at all.** §2.3 says the terminal is a cell grid and
not a byte stream, so there is nowhere in a `write` for a colour to ride: an
escape sequence is precisely what the invariant exists to refuse, and the
kernel's `screen_write` would paint `\x1b[1m` as five cells. The kernel has had
`screen_style` since M2 and `show_motd` is its caller — green, then white again
— but a process could not reach it. What a process *could* colour was a grid of
its own, blitted with `ScreenBlit`, and that is refused without the alternate
screen; taking the alternate screen blanks the grid the prompt lives in. This is
the same wall `Sys::Cursor` was built against when the shell became a program,
and the answer is the same shape.

The argument fits in the op word — `fg | bg << 8 | attrs << 16`, three bytes of
the available three — so the operation stages nothing and costs one park and one
step, the cheapest an asynchronous syscall gets. It carries no reply data
either. The rule that keeps the table honest is that every operation has a
caller, and this one has exactly one: `/bin/sh`.

**Sticky, and the prompt is what cleans up.** The style is grid state, not a
property of a write, which is how it already worked for the kernel. So the
convention is that whoever sets a colour puts the default back, and `anchor`
does: red for the status, bright white for the `$`, then plain white before the
cursor comes back — so what is typed is ordinary text and so a program the line
starts inherits nothing. That last reset is also the repair for a program that
dies halfway through a colour of its own. The screen cannot stay wrong for
longer than one command, because the next prompt names all three fields
unconditionally.

The alternative — a colour argument on `Write`, or a style word in a write's
payload — was worse in the way that matters: it would put a second meaning into
the one operation every program uses, and a pipe would have to carry it or drop
it. `Style` is refused from a process that does not hold the screen while
somebody else does, exactly as a cursor set is, and needs no rule beyond that.

**A prompt now costs three more syscalls**, one per style run, on top of the two
`Cursor` calls and the write it already made. It is once per line rather than
once per keystroke, so §4.4's cost model lands where it lands; the six-tick
keystroke is unchanged, since `redraw` sets no style.

The smoke test checks the colours rather than only the text: green motd,
bright-white prompt under it, and after `false` a red `[1]` with a bright-white
`$` beside it. The prompt assertion used to read "not green" — inheriting was
the bug it was written for — and now reads "bright white", which is a stronger
statement about the same cell.

## Selecting with the mouse

The terminal is a cell grid in shared memory, which means the page can read what
is on the screen without asking anyone. So a mouse selection costs **nothing in
the kernel**: no import, no export, no field in the `Screen` descriptor, no key,
no syscall, and no way for a program to find out that one exists. `web/braam.js`
turns a drag into device pixels, `web/render.js` turns those into cells, and the
text crosses back to the page when the drag settles. Concept.md §3.5 says so
now.

The alternative was a mouse event alongside `key()`, which several people would
call the obvious design — a terminal that has a mouse usually tells its programs
about it. It buys nothing here. Nothing in userland wants a click: there is no
`less` mouse mode, no menu, no button. What was asked for was **selection**, and
selection is a view over the grid, not input. Putting it in the kernel would
have meant a selection in the descriptor, a rule about who may clear it, and a
claim to arbitrate two programs wanting it — which is §3.5's terminal-claims
machinery again, for a highlight the renderer can draw by swapping two colours.

**Swapping two colours is exactly what it does.** The cursor was already drawn
and never stored, by reversing the cell it sits on; a selection reverses the
cells it covers, through the same parameter. The two XOR rather than OR, so the
cursor inside a selection is a hole in it — which is the classic behaviour, and
it falls out of the arithmetic rather than being arranged.

### Ctrl+C, twice overloaded

There is no second copy key to give it. `Ctrl+Shift+C` is Chrome's inspector and
cannot be taken; a menu is not something a canvas has. So the chord is
overloaded the way Windows Terminal overloads it: **`Ctrl+C` copies when there
is a selection and interrupts when there is not.** For that to be safe rather
than a trap, a copy has to clear the selection — otherwise the second `^C` in a
row would silently fail to reach a runaway program, which is the one thing `^C`
must never do. A click that never left its cell clears too, which gives an
obvious escape.

The write goes through `navigator.clipboard.writeText` **in the keydown
handler**, not through `Sys::Clip` and `web/svc.js`. That looks like a duplicate
of the clipboard service and is not one: a service reply reaches the page a turn
or more after the keystroke, and by then the transient activation that permits a
clipboard write is gone — the same asymmetry §A.2 records for reading, where the
way out was to wait for a `paste`. There is no equivalent trick for writing, so
the text has to already be on the page when the chord arrives. That is why the
worker posts the selection across when a drag ends rather than when a copy is
asked for, and why the page keeps a copy of it.

The `copy` event was the other candidate — it needs no permission at all. It is
not reliably dispatched to a focused canvas with no document selection behind
it, and when it is not, the chord would be swallowed with nothing copied and no
interrupt sent. `writeText` inside a gesture is supported everywhere and fails
loudly.

### Select all, which Ctrl+A cannot be

`Ctrl+A` is the line editor's beginning-of-line, and unlike `Ctrl+C` it has **no
disambiguator**: copy could be overloaded because "is there a selection?"
answers which of the two was meant, and there is no such question for
select-all. So it is the platform's own chord instead — `Cmd+A`, or
`Ctrl+Shift+A` where there is no `Cmd`. `Cmd+A` was free for the taking:
`Key::printable()` excludes `MOD_META`, so a `Cmd` chord already reached the
kernel and did nothing at all. The Ctrl+Shift form is the weaker half of the
pair, since Firefox and Chrome both bind it to browser UI that a page cannot
intercept; where that happens the Mac chord is the only one, which is worth
knowing but not worth a third binding to work around.

Selecting all made a smaller decision visible: **trailing blank rows do not
travel with a selection.** The grid is a fixed rectangle, so select-all on a
screen with three lines of output on it would otherwise hand over three lines
and thirteen newlines, and a drag past the last line of output would do the same
on a smaller scale. Blank rows *between* lines are content and stay; it is only
the run at the end that goes.

### What it costs to repaint

A selection changes on every mouse move that crosses a cell boundary, and the
highlight is painted by the same `present()` the kernel's damage rectangle
drives — so the renderer repaints the row span the old and new selections cover
between them. Over-painting a few rows during a drag is cheaper than reasoning
about the symmetric difference of two linear spans, and it goes through the path
that already existed rather than a second one.

The selection dies on the next keystroke and on a resize, because the grid has
no line model and no scrollback (§3.5): the cells it names mean something else
as soon as anything scrolls. Holding a selection across output would need the
per-row continuation bit that resize re-wrapping has been waiting for since M7,
and it should land with that or not at all.

### The renderer finally has a test

`web/render.js` had none — there is no canvas in Node, and it was the one
shipping file with no coverage at all. The selection is arithmetic over the
grid, which is testable with a fake `ctx` that records what it was asked to
fill, so `test/run.mjs` now drives a `Renderer` over **the real screen** the
smoke test has just filled by running `echo hello`, and asserts what the drag
reads back, which cells came out reversed, and that select-all and a drag over
everything agree. Both halves of the first pair earn their place: the first
version checked only the text, and a deliberate break of the highlight logic
passed it. Painting and text now share one `bounds()` so they cannot disagree
about what is selected, and mutating it fails the suite.

---

## A boot that says why there is no prompt

Since the shell became a program, a boot archive that will not give up a
runnable `/bin/sh` leaves a terminal with a version banner and nothing under it.
init said one line for it:

```
braam: /bin/sh: not found — the boot archive is broken
```

which was printed for three unrelated causes and was a lie for two of them.
`exec_resolve` had the answer in a `Result` init threw away.

### The error had to be widened before the message could be

`exec_meta` refused a binary with `Err(Invalid)` whether it had no `braam`
section, was not a wasm module at all, or was one of ours built against a
different kernel. Concept.md §4.3 has promised since M8 that the `abi` word
makes *"a stale binary a diagnostic rather than a wrong answer"* — but the wrong
answer and the stale binary were the same value, so the diagnostic could not be
written however carefully init phrased it.

So the magic check keeps `Invalid` and the `abi` check becomes
`Err(Unsupported)`. That is the whole mechanism; everything else is rendering.
It was tempting instead to have `exec_meta` hand back the number it found so the
message could name both, but the value it returns is the metadata and there is
no metadata to return — a section with a foreign `abi` is not a `ProcMeta` this
kernel can read. Naming the kernel's own number is enough to place the fault: a
reader who sees "this kernel speaks 4" knows to look at what built the archive.

The shell gets the same distinction for free, since `Sys::Spawn` resolves
through the same function. A stale archive breaks every typed command, not just
the boot, and `braam: echo: built for another process ABI` is a better first
thing to see than `not executable`. The exit code stays 126: found, and would
not run.

One trap on the way. The natural way to write that is

```cpp
Str why = e == Error::NotFound ? "not found" : e == Error::Unsupported ? "..." : "...";
```

and it does not link. `Str`'s length comes from `__builtin_strlen`, which folds
only when the pointer is a constant; a two-way conditional clang still sees
through, a three-way one it does not, and the result is a call to `strlen` with
no libc to satisfy it. A literal per branch, and the fold comes back. This is
`--allow-undefined` being absent doing its job (§C.3): the alternative was a
runtime trap in the diagnostic path, which is the one path nobody exercises.

### The greeting

`bundle/share/motd` had shipped in the archive since there was an archive and
nothing had ever printed it — only `run.mjs` read it, as a convenient read-only
file. init prints it now, in green, restoring the default style afterwards so
the prompt beneath it is not green too. It is the kernel's first use of colour;
`screen_style` had no caller at all.

It is printed **after** the shell resolves rather than after the mounts, which
is the whole of the ordering decision: a system that is not going to reach a
prompt should show why, not a welcome above a dead terminal. The two are never
on screen together.

Absent is not an error and says nothing. A boot archive without a greeting is
not a broken one, and a line reporting its absence would be noise at every boot
of one.

`show_motd` is a coroutine of its own rather than four lines inside `init_task`,
for the reason `boot_filesystem` is one: it holds the whole file, and a frame
past 512 bytes costs a whole 64 KiB span (§8.2). That is also why `read_file`
moved out of `exec.cpp`'s anonymous namespace into `src/user/io.{h,cpp}` —
`boot.cpp` could not reach it where it was, `io.h` already holds `FileIo` and
`file_open_read`, and the process-side twin is declared in exactly that place in
`src/proc/io.h`.

### The farewell carries the status

`braam: the shell exited (status 7) — reload to start again`. A shell the user
typed `exit` at and one that died on its first step looked identical from init,
and the second is the interesting case: `exec_process` prints
`will not instantiate` or `crashed` through `io.err` — which *is* the grid here
— and the status line under it now says which.

### The banner fits on one line again

It was 82 cells and the grid at boot is 80 columns, so it wrapped — and the
comment above `screen_resize(80, 24)` claimed the host's first `resize()` would
reflow it, which is not what resize does: it moves rows and drops from the top,
and never re-wraps a logical line (§3.5's unkept promise to M7). A banner that
wraps at boot therefore stays wrapped in a terminal of any width. Dropping the
word `reserved` takes it to 73, with enough headroom for a four-digit revision
count and a slower machine's boot time, and the comment now says what the
constraint is so the next line added to it is measured rather than assumed.

### What is not covered

The three broken-archive paths have no smoke case. Testing them means booting a
fresh instance against a patched `bundle.bin`, which `run.mjs` has the machinery
for — `store.reset()` and a new instance, as the no-OPFS case does — but a
corruption is written by hand against the BBND layout and would be a second,
weaker copy of what `test_sysabi` already asserts about `exec_meta`. What the
smoke test does check is the greeting: that it reaches the grid, that it is
green, and that the prompt below it is not.

---

## The shell is a program

`/bin/sh` is a binary in `/bin` that init runs. `src/user/shell.cpp`,
`edit.cpp`, `job.cpp` and the six builtins are gone from the kernel and live in
`src/sh/`, compiled into one 81 KB module. `kernel.wasm` fell from 185,205 bytes
to 136,699 — a quarter of it was the shell. The §4.3 table grew by two, `cursor`
and `fg`, and `PROC_ABI` is 4.

There is now **no in-kernel program of any kind**. §4's tier table had one row
that was not a tier — *"none: it **is** the shell"* — and that row is what this
change deletes.

**What made it possible was already there.** An earlier scoping of this put it
at M8-sized: a whole syscall family, descriptor passing, per-process cwd, three
pieces of kernel state §3.6 refuses. Every one of those had landed in the three
changes above by the time this started, and `watch` was already building a
pipeline, moving a descriptor into a child, draining it and reaping it — in 125
lines. What was left was the terminal, and only the terminal.

### The four things a prompt could not do

1. **Find the cursor.** The line editor read `screen().cursor_x/_y` and called
   `screen_move` on the *scrolling* grid. `ScreenBlit` is the only cursor-setter
   in the ABI and it is refused without the alternate screen — and taking the
   alternate screen blanks the grid the prompt lives in. So: `Sys::Cursor`, get
   and set in one operation, on the primary screen.
2. **Be given keys at all when nothing is running.** The pump was spawned per
   foreground pipeline and belonged to the job it watched; at the prompt the
   shell received on `keys()` itself. A process has no `keys()`. So the pump
   became permanent, and init spawns it.
3. **Survive its own `^C`.** The pump cancelled the running pipeline and never
   routed `^C` to a claimant. A shell process holding the keyboard would have
   been cancelled by the interrupt meant to abandon a line.
4. **Name what `^C` should reach instead.** So: `Sys::Fg`.

The last two are one rule: **`^C` cancels the foreground if there is one, and is
delivered to the raw-key claimant if there is not.** A shell at a prompt has
nothing in front, so it gets the key; a shell running a command has put that
command in front, so the command gets cancelled. Both halves fall out of one
branch in the pump.

### Handing over the terminal is a race, and the order is the fix

The first version of `run_line` spawned the stages, put them in front, and
*then* let go of the keyboard. `less` under it printed `less: no keyboard`.

A child is an ordinary scheduler job, so it starts running the moment the shell
next parks — and the shell parks on the very next syscall. A full-screen program
claims the keys in its first step. So by the time the shell got round to
releasing them, the child had already asked and been refused. Ordering cannot
avoid it: every step between spawn and release is a park.

The keyboard therefore goes back **before** anything is spawned. That costs one
thing and it is worth naming: `Sys::Fg` cannot then require the caller to hold
the keys, because the caller has just given them up. The rule is "the caller
must own the terminal — it holds the raw keys, *or* it is itself in front, *or*
nobody is in front", and the last clause is what a shell uses. A background
program cannot use it, because by then its shell's foreground is armed.

The window between the release and the first `Sys::Fg` — a few steps — is the
one moment a `^C` is dropped rather than delivered. Making it airtight needs the
spawn and the arming to be one operation, which would be a worse ABI for a case
a person cannot hit.

### The pump cannot outrun a claimant that is a process

`Channel<Key>` holds 64 and a claimant's ring holds 32, and the pump moves keys
from one to the other without ever suspending — `co_await recv()` does not
suspend while the channel is non-empty. A burst of typing arrives in one tick,
so a line longer than 32 characters lost its tail before the claimant was ever
scheduled. The kernel-side editor had never shown this, because it read the
64-slot channel directly.

Dropping is the right policy for a claimant that has stopped reading — it is
what keeps a wedged program from taking `^C` down with it — but it is the wrong
answer for one that simply has not run yet. So the pump waits for room, through
the timer queue at zero delay, and drops only after `KEY_WAIT` of those. The
host answers a delay of 0 with another pump straight away, so a claimant that is
reading costs microseconds; one that is not costs 64 near-instant ticks and then
a dropped key, with `^C` still arriving on time.

64 rather than 2 because the claimant is a *process* now: every key it reads is
a syscall and a step, so draining three of them is a dozen ticks.

### Type-ahead survives a claim being dropped

`^C` at a prompt abandons the line, drops the editor's claim, and takes a new
one for the next prompt. Anything typed after the `^C` was sitting in the ring
that just went — and used to be sitting in `keys()`, where the next `read_line`
would find it. `~KeyInput` therefore puts what it never read back on the
channel. The pump has drained the channel by the time anything can release a
claim, so this arrives ahead of whatever the host queues next rather than behind
it.

### The console is a device, so its end of input is not the channel's

`^D` closes the cooked channel, and the next command has to be able to read. A
pipe is closed once and dies; the console is not a pipe. `Channel::reopen()`
undoes `close()` and leaves queued values and parked tokens alone, which
matters: the alternative was rebuilding the channel in place, and a reader still
unwinding from the previous foreground would have been parked on a corpse.

Arming a new foreground is what reopens it, and also what *clears* it:
type-ahead meant for what has gone is not input for what replaces it.

### What the shell gave up, and what it gained

- **`kill <pid>` is gone**; `kill %n` is not. `Sys::Kill` refuses anything that
  is not a child of the caller, and a bare pid the shell never started is
  exactly that. The authority it needed was never the shell's to have once the
  shell became a process.
- **`/proc/jobs` is gone.** The table is a process's own memory now, and no
  syscall shows one process another's. The stages are still scheduler tasks, so
  `/proc/<pid>` still lists them — which is how the shell notices a background
  job has finished, since a `wait` would park and the prompt has to come back
  either way.
- **A builtin in a pipeline runs in its turn, not alongside.** Nothing inside a
  process can wait for a sibling task: the only resumption a task has is a
  syscall reply. So builtins are run to completion in pipeline order, and each
  must write its output *once* — a pipe holds eight chunks, and a builtin
  writing a line at a time would fill one and park with nobody left to drain it.
  `jobs | help` still works, and that is the constraint that keeps it working.
- **`sh -s`** reads stdin a line at a time instead of drawing a prompt, which is
  what a script is, and it costs four lines because the loop was already there.
- **A second shell is now writable at all** — and was, in fact, how this was
  built. `/bin/sh` ran as a child of the resident one for the whole of its
  development, exercised from the prompt and in `run.mjs`, and the flip was the
  last commit rather than the first.

### The cost, measured

A keystroke at the prompt was one channel receive and a few writes into an
array. It is now `key_read`, then a repaint of four syscalls — cursor off, one
write of the whole line, a cursor read to find the scroll, and the cursor back
on — each of them a park, a step and a resume. Six or so ticks per key.

`run.mjs` had asserted exactly one `present` per keystroke; it now asserts one
per *tick*, which is what M2 actually asked for and what still happens. The rest
of the driver needed one other change: `net.proc.live()` is never zero any more,
because the shell is an instance and a permanent one, so sixteen assertions went
through a helper that subtracts it.

### Smaller decisions

- **`Args` was defined twice, identically**, in `src/user/prog.h` and
  `src/proc/rt.h`. The grammar needed it on both sides of the boundary, so it
  moved to `src/kernel/args.h` and the copies went. `parse.cpp` and
  `tokenize.cpp` now compile unchanged into the shell binary and into the test
  suite, from one source, because they touch nothing but `Str`, `String` and
  `Vec`.
- **`Sys::Open` did not honour `SYS_O_APPEND`.** Nothing below the VFS is
  seekable, so appending is a starting offset the descriptor's owner keeps — and
  the kernel-side shell did that for itself while `Sys::Open` did not. Latent
  until a *process* opened a file to append to, which is the first thing `sh`
  does with `>>`.
- **`proc.shutdown()` cleared every process record**, which was correct while
  none was permanent and wrong the moment the shell became one: the test that
  simulates a host with no workers was killing the shell. It split into
  `shutdown` (dispose: everything) and `dropWorkers` (the pool and the tier it
  backs, leaving tier 2 alone), which is what §4's fallback actually means.
- **`SYS_CHILD_MAX` is 16**, from 8: a pipeline is up to eight stages and a
  background job the shell has not reaped yet still holds an entry.
  **`PROC_TASKS` is 8**, from 4, because the shell is the first process that
  wants more than two.
- **The shell stays at tier 2.** Tier 3 would put two `postMessage` hops under
  every keystroke, and the kill switch it buys is no use to the one process
  nobody can be spawned to kill.
- **`bundle.bin` is ~491 KB**, from ~406 KB: `sh.wasm` is 81 KB of grammar, line
  editor, job runtime and builtins, and it carries its own copy of the allocator
  and the coroutine runtime like every other binary. §4.4's duplication,
  arriving where it always does.

### What this did not do

`/bin/sh` has no variables, no `-c`, no globbing and no scripts beyond `sh -s`.
None of that was blocked by the shell being kernel code and none of it is
blocked now; they were simply never written, and the point of this change was to
move the shell without changing what it does.

---

## A descriptor is held for the length of a syscall

The gap the previous change left open — a `Body` or a `Socket` closed by one
task while another is parked reading it — is closed, and closed for every kind
at once rather than for the two the note named. The rule is the one the pipe
ends already had, moved up a level:

> A `Handle` is born with one reference, held by the descriptor table. A syscall
> performed on it takes one more for the length of the call. `Close` frees the
> number and shuts what is behind the descriptor **at once**; the block, and the
> externref slot in it, goes when the last reference does.

Nothing about the wire moved: no wasm ABI, no §4.3 operation, no `PROC_ABI`, and
no JavaScript.

**It was worse than a stale write.** `h->off += r.value().size()` through a
freed block was the visible half, and `proc_bind` reuses a freed slot before it
grows the table, so a `Close`+`Open` pair under a parked read could land that
write on a live descriptor's offset. The half that decided the shape of the fix
is one level down. `~Handle` reaches `~JsHandle`, which tells the host to let
go, and *then* `~JsRef`, which nulls the table entry and pushes the slot onto a
LIFO free list — so the next `ws_open` or `fetch` anywhere in the system takes
that slot straight back. Meanwhile `HostCall::issue()` re-reads `jsref_get` on
**every** attempt, and `svc_blob` issues twice whenever the reply does not fit
in 512 bytes, which is the path `ws_recv` and `pick_name` take for anything
long. The window between the first attempt suspending and the second issuing is
exactly where another task's `Close` runs, so a parked socket read could be
re-issued against another process's socket. That is why deferring the free was
not enough on its own and the slot had to stay reserved.

**Shutting is therefore separate from freeing**, and that separation is load
bearing in the other direction too. `Close` on a pipe end must still
`close()`/`hangup()` at once, because that is what wakes the other end;
deferring it to the last reference would have left a reader parked for ever on a
pipe whose writer had just gone. So `Handle::shut()` does what the destructor
used to do — `FileIo::reset`, `JsHandle::drop`, `PipeEnd::shut` — and the
destructor now only releases. A parked call sees the end it should: a dropped
socket answers `Err(Closed)`, a cancelled body an empty chunk, a hung-up pipe
end of input, all of which were already status 0 on this wire.
`JsHandle::drop()` is the new seam, and it is idempotent because the destructor
still calls it.

**`PickFile` was missing from the recorded gap** and had the hazard twice: it
shares the `off` write, and it reads through a *second* descriptor. Resolving
the set by number rather than by pointer was already deliberate — closing the
set first should be `Err(Invalid)` at the next read — so the lookup stays where
it was and only the reference is new. A set closed *before* a read is still
refused; a set closed *during* one is held to the end of it.

**The busy guard came along, and its reason is not the pipes' reason.**
`busy_r`/`busy_w` moved off `ProcPipe` onto `Handle`, so one reader and one
writer at a time is now the rule for every kind. On a pipe end that is a kernel
invariant: `Channel` panics on a second blocked sender and displaces a second
suspended receiver silently. On the host kinds nothing panics — two outstanding
calls against one slot are well formed — and the honest statement is weaker:
`svc_blob`'s sized-twice reply is not re-entrant per object, so a second reader
consumes the message the first sized itself for and the first exhausts its two
attempts into `Err(Io)`; and `off` would advance twice. A defined refusal beats
a race a program cannot avoid other than by not running it. The guard is per
*direction* and had to be: a `Socket` is one `Handle` serving both, and `chat`'s
receiver reads it while the root task writes it, so a `refs > 1` test would have
broken `chat` on the first message typed.

**Two refusals were added to `Sys::Spawn`.** A descriptor a syscall of the
parent is inside of cannot be moved into a child: refcounting makes that case
memory-safe without making it correct, since a parked reader in the parent plus
the child's stdio is the second receiver the move exists to make
unrepresentable. And the take is now all-or-nothing.

**The take, and why the commit moved to the end.** The old loop nulled the
parent's slots as it went, so a refusal on the second or third left the first
already moved into a `Spawned` about to be destroyed — the parent silently lost
a descriptor on a spawn that failed. It was reachable with two verdicts already
and the new one made three. The fix is a validate pass where the loop was and a
commit pass at the very end of the function, past `sched_spawn` and past the
child's entry being recorded, so every failure leaves the parent's table exactly
as it found it. That works because `sched_spawn` only *queues* the task — a
`Task` is lazy, which the surrounding code already relied on when it assigned
`s->pid` after the spawn — and because there is no await anywhere from the
validate pass to the end, so nothing can resume the child in between. A restore
guard was the obvious alternative and is worse: it would hand a descriptor back
to the parent while a cancelled child job still named it through its stdio,
which is the two-owners case this change is otherwise closing.
`p.children.reserve` before the spawn is what removes the one failure that would
otherwise have sat between the two passes.

The duplicate-descriptor check at the top of the syscall is now load bearing in
a way it was not: before, two slots naming one descriptor were refused as a side
effect of the nulling. After the split they would validate twice and be
committed into two `moved[]` entries, which `~Spawned` would release twice, so
the up-front check is the only thing refusing them and says so.

**What the tests pin.** The unit case is the one that fails without the fix: a
socket the host has been told to let go of still answers a read, and its slot is
still counted until the handle goes. The `chat` case is a characterisation — end
of input now closes the connection in the program rather than leaving it to
teardown, which is a better program and also the one sequence a shipped binary
can arrange, since the receiver is parked on that socket while the root task
waits for the `Close` reply. Neither of the two new `Sys::Spawn` refusals is
reachable from `/bin`: no shipped program names two descriptors in a spawn, and
none both spawns and reads from a second task. They are pinned by the ABI and by
this note, not by the suite.

**The cost.** Two bools and a `u32` on `Handle`, a `bool` on `JsHandle`, a
seven-way `shut()` and one free function, against the deletion of `PipeRef`,
`PipeBusy` and two `ProcPipe` fields — 1,524 bytes on the kernel, which is 70%
of its budget rather than 69%, and 189 on `chat` for the close it now makes
itself.

## One claimant, named by pid

The terminal's three routes through the tty pump — raw keys, the screen, cooked
bytes — now have one holder each, on the kernel. A second claim is `Err(Perm)`
rather than a nested one, a claim clears its route only if it is still the
holder, and the two a process makes carry its pid. This is the change the
previous section left undone, and it changed no ABI: the same five terminal
operations, the same wire format, and nothing in `src/cmd/`, because `less` and
`edit` already treat a refused claim as fatal and say `less: no keyboard`.

**Nesting was a stack with no owner.** `KeyInput` saved the predecessor's ring
and `InputClaim` the predecessor's pipe, so both were correct exactly as long as
claims were destroyed in the order they were made. Nothing enforced that and
nothing could: a claim's lifetime is its process's kernel-side record, and two
processes die in whichever order they die. Out of order, `~KeyInput` restored a
ring its owner had already freed and the pump `try_send`s keystrokes into it;
`~InputClaim` had no guard at all and restored a pipe belonging to a job that
had finished. Both are use-after-free, reachable from the prompt with `fg %1 &`
twice.

`FullScreen` was worse for being subtler. It saved no predecessor because it
saves the *cells*, so a second claimant snapshotted the blank grid the first had
just cleared and handed *that* back on the way out. The shell's screen was not
corrupted so much as quietly replaced by nothing — and `ScreenEnter`'s
`Err(Perm)` did not catch it, because it tested the claiming process's own
record rather than the route.

**Refusal rather than a queue or a stack.** The alternative was to make the
claim a real stack with owners, so a child could take the screen and give it
back to its parent. That is a window manager's problem with a window manager's
answer, and `Pane` is a primitive rather than a multiplexer for the same reason
(Concept.md §3.5). Refusal is the answer that costs one branch and cannot be got
wrong: whoever asks second is told no, and finds out by the same `Err(Perm)` a
program already handles.

**The pid is on the two a process makes, and not on the third.** `KeyInput` and
`FullScreen` are built by the `Sys::KeyClaim`/`Sys::ScreenEnter` arm of
`exec.cpp`, which has the pid in hand on `Proc`. `InputClaim`'s only claimant is
`fg`, a builtin — a pipeline stage rather than a process, with no `Proc` and no
pid it can name itself with, since the scheduler's ready queue holds bare
coroutine handles and there is no `sched_current()` to add cheaply. So the
cooked route is owned by the claim object instead: same rule, same refusal, an
identity that is a pointer rather than a number. A refused `fg` disowns rather
than kills the job it was about to adopt, because the job was running before it
asked and being told no is not a reason to end it.

**`ScreenBlit` is checked; `ScreenClear` is not.** A blit is what the claim
exists for, so a blit from a process without the screen is `Err(Perm)` — it
would be painting over whichever process does hold it. `ScreenClear` stays open
because `clear` and `watch` blank the shell's own screen without ever claiming
it, and refusing them would be a change to two programs to enforce a rule about
a third. Ordinary output is the same story a level down: a background job still
writes to the grid through `stdout`, and gating *that* is output routing, not a
claim.

**The release stays in `~Proc`.** Moving it into `exec_process`'s `End`, where a
process demonstrably dies, would give the screen back promptly — and would free
a `KeyRing` with a cancelled `KeyRead` server still parked on it, since `End`
queues the cancellation rather than unwinding it. So the release still lags a
process's death by the tick or two the last server takes to unwind, exactly as
it did before. What changed is what that window costs: a claim arriving inside
it is refused, where before it was granted and corrupted the grid.

Two tests, because the two halves are testable in different places.
`test/unit/test_tty.cpp` drives the claim types directly — the in-wasm tests
cannot run a program, and it builds the out-of-order case on the heap because a
scope cannot express it. `test/run.mjs` covers the syscall path with
`less /share/doc/README | less`, two pagers in one pipeline, which is how a
second claimant is reached from the prompt without writing a program for it. It
asserts that one of them took the screen, that the other said
`less: no keyboard`, and that the shell's screen came back — not *which* stage
won, since that is scheduler order rather than contract. Before the change the
second claimant snapshotted the blank grid and the prompt came back to nothing.

## Processes that spawn processes

Five operations — `chdir`, `pipe`, `spawn`, `wait`, `kill` — take the §4.3 table
from twenty-seven to thirty-two, and every process gets a working directory of
its own. `PROC_ABI` is
3. The shell stays resident: it is not a process, and `cd` is still a builtin.

**What forced it.** A program whose job is to run another program had nowhere to
live. It could not be a builtin — the six that exist are the six no syscall
could serve, and running a child inside the shell's own frame would be the
applet tier coming back through the side door — and it could not be a binary,
because a binary had no way to start one. So `timeout`, `watch` and `xargs` were
not unwritten but unwritable, and the gap was in the ABI rather than in
`src/cmd/`. The two that landed are the two the rule allows: every operation has
a caller, and `timeout` covers `spawn`/`wait`/`kill` while `watch` is the one
program that wants what its child *printed* rather than wanting it printed.

**Why `chdir` came with them.** M5 recorded that a per-process cwd had nowhere
to live "until §4.3's ABI gives a process a context, which is M8". M8 landed and
the global stayed, which was defensible while nothing could spawn: with one
shell running, a global and a per-process cwd are indistinguishable. A child
changes that immediately — `ls` in a spawned process would walk the shell's
directory rather than its parent's, and `Spawn` would be incoherent before it
was useful. The two arrived together for that reason and not for tidiness.

`chdir` is numbered 24, with the filesystem block, rather than 84 with the
process family. It is the state `open`, `stat`, `list`, `mkdir` and `remove`
resolve *against*, so it belongs with the operations it governs; a program that
never spawns anything still moves it. Its caller is `pwd`, which stopped reading
`/proc/cwd` — ProcFs generates a file at `open` and has no way to know who is
reading, so that file can only ever be one answer, and the one answer is the
shell's. This is the one place the "publish it under /proc instead" argument
runs out, and it is worth naming: the question `pwd` asks is not "what is the
cwd" but "what is *mine*".

**The dispatcher resolves, and the VFS did not have to change.** The obvious
move was a cwd-parametric twin of each of the six `vfs_*` entry points. None was
needed. `path_resolve` already takes its cwd as an argument and already ignores
it for an absolute path, so the five sites in `proc_syscall` resolve against
`p.cwd` and hand the VFS something absolute, and `vfs_abs`'s second pass is a
copy that changes nothing. One helper, five call sites, and
`vfs_cwd`/`vfs_chdir` left alone as what they always were: the shell's.
`test_path` now asserts the idempotence that whole simplification rests on.

**A descriptor moves into a child rather than being duplicated.** POSIX dups and
expects the parent to close its copy; forgetting is the classic bug where the
reader never sees end of input, because a write end is still open in a process
that will never write. Moving makes it unrepresentable, and that is the smaller
half of the argument. The larger half is that a `Channel` has one receiver and
*panics* on a second blocked sender — a tripwire M4 put there deliberately — so
two processes holding one pipe end would be a user program reaching a kernel
invariant. One end, one owner, by construction. Within a process the same rule
is enforced by hand: a second concurrent read or write on an end is `Err(Perm)`,
because a second sender panics and a second receiver is displaced *silently*,
which is worse.

### The ownership chain, and the bug it was hiding

The subtle half of this change is not the wire. A child inheriting fds 0/1/2
gets a copy of its parent's `Stdio` — three function pointers and a ctx — and
that ctx is a `Pipe` owned by the shell's refcounted `Job` block, released when
the stage's frame is destroyed. A child is an independent scheduler job and
cancellation is deferred, so it would still be unwinding a tick after the block
was freed, deregistering a waiter from a `Channel` that no longer existed.

Writing that down made it obvious that **the bug was already there**, with no
children involved. `~End` cancels a process's syscall servers, but
`sched_cancel` only pushes a frame onto the ready queue, and `sched_tick`'s
drain has finished by the time the sweep destroys the stage. A server parked in
`p.io.out.write()` therefore unwinds *after* `StageEnd` released the `Job`. The
second one was smaller and in the same function: `serve` read `c->token` before
the `Cancelled` check that would have told it `~Proc` had already freed the
`Call`.

The fix is one rule — *anything that can still touch a `Stdio` it did not create
holds a reference for as long as that is true* — and three holders of it.
`Stdio` carries a `hold`/`owner` pair naming the block behind its three streams
(null is the console, which nobody owns). `Proc` retains it and releases it last
in `~Proc`, after the handle table, because a redirected `File` handle closes
through the VFS and lives in that same block. And every syscall server takes a
counted `ProcRef` **by value as a coroutine parameter**.

That last detail is the whole thing, so it is worth stating plainly: a
coroutine's parameter copies are destroyed when the frame is, which is *after*
the body's locals — and one of those locals is the awaitable that deregisters
from the pipe in its destructor. The reference therefore outlives the
deregistration by construction rather than by luck. `~End` stops deleting the
record; it marks it dead, unlinks it so a late syscall is `NotFound`, and drops
one reference.

A parent-created pipe needs none of this. A `ProcPipe` is refcounted and
reachable only through the handles holding its ends, so moving one into a child
transfers the pointer and the child keeps the channel alive with no `Job`
involved. The owner reference is for fds 0/1/2 alone.

**The cost, stated.** Two words on `Stdio`, one `u32` on `Proc`, one refcount
bump per syscall, and a shell `Job` that may outlive `run_line` for as long as a
spawned descendant is alive — bounded, because a process's destructor cancels
its children the way `run_line` cancels its stages. §3.6's structured
concurrency, put back by hand a second time.

### What this did not fix

Two things were found while doing it and deliberately not folded in, because
each is its own change and neither is made worse by this one.

The terminal claim assumed it would be destroyed in the order it was made, and
`ScreenEnter`'s `Err(Perm)` was per-process rather than global — a parent and a
child made two claimants natural where they had only been reachable. That is the
section above, done since.

And a `Body` or a `Socket` can still have its descriptor closed by one task
while another is parked reading it. The pipe ends take a counted reference for
the length of the call; the older kinds do not.

### Smaller decisions

- **All five are asynchronous**, which costs a park and a step even for a `wait`
  on a child that has already exited. The synchronous half is closed at four
  permanently and for a reason that has not weakened: tier 3 answers those four
  inside the process's own worker, and a fifth would fail at tier 3 alone. The
  upside is that **no JavaScript changed at all** — `sys_async` is opaque to
  `web/proc.js`, `web/procworker.js` and the fakes, so a new operation really is
  a number on each side.
- **The caps are eight children and eight levels.** Every child is an instance
  with a 16 MB cap, so nothing else would stop the first fork bomb. Past either
  is `Err(NoMemory)` and deliberately *not* `Err(Again)`, which `proc_syscall`
  retries for ever.
- **`SYS_PID_MAX` is 0xffffff**, because `wait` and `kill` carry the pid in the
  op word's 24-bit argument. `Spawn` refuses to hand back a pid above it: a
  truncated pid would name somebody else's process rather than nothing. Pids are
  never reused, so the parent a finishing child looks up by number cannot be a
  different one.
- **A status is clamped to 0–255 when recorded.** `Sys::Exit` takes whatever the
  program passed, and a negative status on this wire is an error code.
- **`Wait` holds no pointer across its await.** A concurrent `Spawn` in another
  task of the same process pushes onto the child `Vec` and moves every element,
  so the parked call re-finds its child by pid on the way out as well as on the
  way in.
- **`Spawn` resolves before it takes the descriptors.** A name that turns out
  not to be a command leaves the parent's table as it found it, and there is no
  await between taking them and spawning, which is what makes the take atomic
  against another task closing one.
- **`tools/stamp.py` reads `PROC_ABI` out of `sysabi.h`** rather than restating
  it. The old copy fell behind the moment the number moved, and it stamps the
  field whose whole job is to make a stale binary a diagnostic — a wrong copy
  there is the one place the mechanism cannot report itself.
- **The test driver now loops while `tick` reports 0.** It stopped when the
  *host* had nothing left to do, but a wake issued during the scheduler's
  end-of-tick sweep — a child reporting its status to its parent, exactly —
  lands on the ready queue after the drain that would have run it.
  `web/worker.js` has always answered a delay of 0 with another pump; the driver
  now does the same, which is one fewer way for it to disagree with the browser.
- **The boot archive is ~400 KB**, from ~379 KB: two more binaries, each
  carrying its own copy of everything. §4.4's duplication, still arriving on
  schedule.

## System_Calls.md, and what writing it found

The kernel↔process mechanism was documented in three places that each held a
piece of it: Concept.md §4.3 fixed the ABI and said why it has its shape, this
file argued each decision under M8 and M9, and the source comments said what
each line does. Nobody had written it down end to end.
[System_Calls.md](System_Calls.md) does that — the deferred step, the staging
protocol, descriptors, the terminal calls, cancellation and the kill, with
sequence diagrams of the calls that actually happen and the whole
twenty-seven-operation table in one place.

**Why a fourth document rather than a longer §4.3.** Concept.md is a
specification and is read by someone deciding whether a change is allowed; it
earns its brevity by not explaining twice. The thing a newcomer needs is the
opposite — the same mechanism at length, in the order it happens, with the code
beside it. Those are different documents for the same reason a standard and a
textbook are, and merging them would have made §4.3 worse at the job it already
does. So System_Calls.md is explicitly derived: read it to understand the
mechanism, amend §4.3 to change it.

Two things it says that no file said before, both of which cost time to work out
from the code. **There are two token namespaces**, and they travel together: the
host-request token that `wake()` answers and names a suspended *kernel* task,
and the process syscall token that rides in the step request's `flags` and names
which of the *process's* parked awaits a `_resume` answers. And
**`await_ready()` is unconditionally false**, so an asynchronous syscall always
costs a park and a step even where the kernel could have answered at once —
which is the cost model a program author needs before writing a loop, and it was
previously only visible by noticing what `SysCall` does not override.

**The consistency pass.** Reading the whole mechanism against the tree turned up
documentation that had drifted, and it is worth recording what kind, because it
was not the kind expected. Little of it was the applet retirement — that change
carried its own notes, and the milestone record already said how to read every
milestone under it. The stale things were older and quieter:

- **Concept.md §3.4 listed a `host_random` import that was never built.** Six
  imports is a number asserted by `test/run.mjs` and quoted in three documents,
  so a seventh name in the block reads as an ABI rather than as an intention. It
  is now marked unbuilt rather than deleted, which is the treatment the section
  already gave `host_fetch`.
- **§3.6 described a `Process` type that never existed.** What the kernel has is
  a scheduler job: a `Task<i32>`, a name and a `CancelToken`. argv and stdio
  belong to the pipeline stage and the working directory is a global, which §4
  says two hundred lines further down.
- **§3.6 still promised structured concurrency** — "a parent `co_await`s a child
  group, and cancellation propagates down the tree". M4 found that
  `CancelState::waiting` is a single slot and rebuilt the relationship by hand
  from a destructor in `run_line`'s frame; the departure was written up here and
  in CLAUDE.md, and the specification was never amended to match. It is now, and
  it names the intrusive queue links a real child-group awaitable would need
  first.
- **§4.3 said the operation table grew by seven.** It grew by nineteen, from
  eight to twenty-seven: the seven named, plus the host services that hand back
  a descriptor and the five terminal operations. The undercount had survived
  because the sentence was true when written.
- **§5.1 listed a `/var` nothing mounts and a `HostFs` on `/mnt/host`** that has
  no implementation — and whose name was taken in the meantime by
  `src/fs/hostfs.h`, which is the storage ABI. §5.4's picker-backed `mount` is
  likewise unbuilt: `vfs_mount` is called from boot and from nowhere else, and
  `mount` the command reformats `/proc/mounts`.
- **§7 said `braam_ui` was a sibling of `braam_fs` and `braam_svc`, above the
  kernel.** It is in neither hierarchy: `braam_proc` links it and `kernel.wasm`
  does not link it at all, which is what "the programs that paint are binaries"
  means at the build level.

The general shape is that a *name* outliving its referent is caught by grep, and
the drift that matters is not. `Process`, `host_random` and the child-group
promise were all found by reading the document against the code, and a sampling
search would have found none of them. Estimates drift the same way: "roughly 300
lines of JavaScript" for a 176-line renderer, "about 200 lines" for a 372-line
allocator, "a ~25-line shim" for a file that is 124. Those are now the tree's
numbers, or gone where a number was never the point.

Exact byte counts came out of README.md and CLAUDE.md for a related reason. The
version header embeds the commit count and the hash, so `kernel.wasm` moves a
few hundred bytes on every commit and a pinned figure in a living document is
stale by the next one. They now say "about 169 KB against a 256 KiB budget"; the
exact numbers stay here, where they are a dated snapshot and mean something.

Nothing executable changed. The one finding that could have gone either way is
`src/proc/screen.h`, which claimed its destructor gives the screen and the
keyboard back "as politeness" — `~ProcScreen` frees its grid and does no such
thing. The comment was corrected rather than the code, because a destructor
*cannot* release a claim: releasing one is a syscall and there is nothing to
await with. `~Proc` does it kernel-side, which it has to anyway, since a killed
process runs no destructor of its own.

## Warnings are errors, everywhere

`BRAAM_WERROR` defaults to ON and `-Wshadow` joins `-Wall -Wextra`. It had been
CI-only since M0, which sounds like the same thing and is not: the developer who
can still fix the code cheaply is the one who does not see the failure, and CI
reports it to whoever pushes next. `rows_equal` in `test_shell.cpp` is the proof
— the applet retirement deleted its only caller and left an unused function
warning sitting in the tree, invisible to every local build.

`-Wshadow` is the one warning worth adding on purpose here rather than trusting
to review. A coroutine frame keeps every local alive across a suspension, so an
inner `Result<usize> r` over an outer one is not the transient confusion it is
in straight-line code: the two have different lifetimes and the wrong one can be
the one that survives a `co_await`. The tree needed no changes to build clean
under it, which is the argument for turning it on now rather than after it would
cost something.

The option stays, because a bisect through old commits with a newer clang meets
warnings that did not exist when they were written, and `-DBRAAM_WERROR=OFF` is
the difference between reading that history and not. It is for that, not for
pushing past a warning of one's own.

## 0.2 — A version that names the commit

The version is `0.2.24-35f6924`: a base edited by hand, then a commit count and
a short hash that nobody edits. The hand-edited patch number it replaces was
wrong more often than it was right — it moved when someone remembered, so two
archives could carry one name and a banner could describe a tree from a week
earlier. A commit count is not a semantic patch level and does not pretend to be
one; it is an identifier that cannot go stale, and the two numbers in front of
it are still the ones that mean something.

**The count orders builds and the hash identifies one.** Either alone is half an
answer. A count says which of two builds is later and is ambiguous across
branches, where two commits share a number; a hash names exactly one tree and
says nothing about age, so `a3f19c2` against `35f6924` is unreadable without a
repository to ask. Together they are sortable by eye and exact, which is what a
bug report pasted out of the boot banner has to be. The hash is `%h` rather than
the full 40: it is being read aloud and typed, and git's abbreviation grows on
its own when the short form stops being unique.

**It is taken at build time, for the same reason the archive name was.** M7's
`file(STRINGS)` argument was that editing a header does not re-run cmake;
committing does not either, and it is the more frequent event. So
`tools/version.py` runs from an always-run target and writes
`build/gen/kernel/revision.h`, which `version.h` includes — the one generated
file in the tree, and small enough that the alternative (a `-D` on the compile
line, fixed at configure time) is just the stale case wearing a different hat.
It rewrites the header only when the revision changes, so `make` after a rebuild
relinks nothing; without that, every build would recompile three translation
units and relink the kernel and a binary to no effect.

**One implementation, two callers.** The kernel gets the string through the
generated header and `release.py` imports `version.py`, rather than each parsing
`version.h` with a regex of its own. That was the shape before, and it was
already one regex too many: the archive is named after what the banner prints,
so the two agreeing is the whole requirement.

Three edges are answered rather than left to surprise someone. A tree with no
repository — an unpacked release building itself — is revision `0` with no hash
instead of a failure, because the base still identifies it and a build that dies
for want of `git` is a worse trade. CI checks out with `fetch-depth: 0`: the
default shallow clone answers 1 to `rev-list --count`, which is not an error
anywhere, merely a wrong version on every artifact it builds. And a build from a
dirty tree names the last commit, which is the honest limit of a hash rather
than a bug — an uncommitted change has no identity to print, and a `-dirty`
suffix would make every working build look suspect while saying nothing about
what changed.

## One program model — retiring the kernel applet

There is one kind of program now. `src/prog/` is gone, the program registry with
it, and every command in the system is a wasm binary in an instance of its own
with a 16 MB cap, a descriptor table nobody else can name, and a kill switch.
`kernel.wasm` went from 236,965 bytes to 168,804 — a quarter of it was userland
— and the boot archive from 47 KB to 379 KB, which is the same code paying
§4.4's duplication cost instead.

**Why the applet had to go rather than stay as a fast path.** It was not a tier
so much as a second program model. Two models meant two `Args` types, two
`io.h`s, and `cat` written twice; they had already begun to diverge, since only
one of them could be tested by the in-wasm suite and only one of them had a
memory cap. The tiering argument in §4 is that isolation is chosen by trust —
but nothing in `src/prog/` was more trusted than `wc`, it was merely older.
Keeping a tier for "programs we happened to write first" is not a trust
boundary, and it was the tier with nothing between a bug and the kernel's heap.

**What the ABI cost.** M8 fixed the syscall table at eight and wrote down the
rule that keeps it honest: every operation has a caller, because a syscall
nothing calls is an ABI nothing tests. Moving thirty programs across meant the
table had to grow to whatever they actually reached for, and it roughly tripled
— the filesystem's `stat`, `list`, `mkdir` and `remove`; `sleep`; the host
services behind `curl`, `date`, `df`, the clipboard and the file picker; and a
terminal family for the two full-screen programs. Every one of them has a caller
in `src/cmd/`, and three programs got none at all: `pwd` reads a new
`/proc/cwd`, `mount` reformats `/proc/mounts`, and `version` is a constant.
Publishing a line of text under `/proc` is cheaper than an operation and leaves
`cat` and `grep` able to read it, which is the same argument M7 made for `/proc`
existing.

**Descriptors did most of the work.** The alternative to a `fetch` family, a
socket family and a picker family was to make each of them hand back a
descriptor, and let `read`, `write` and `close` serve all three. That saved
perhaps six operations, but the reason to prefer it is what happens on `^C`: the
process's handle table dies with the process, `JsRef`'s destructor releases the
externref slot, and the socket closes with no code written for it. The M6 and M8
machinery composed exactly as designed, which is the strongest evidence either
was designed right.

**The terminal is where the cell grid paid off.** A full-screen program cannot
be given the kernel's grid — it is in another address space — so it paints a
grid of its own and blits the damaged rectangle across with one syscall, cursor
included. `src/ui/` became a library over a `Grid` rather than over the kernel's
screen, which is what let `Pane`, `TextBuf` and `TextView` link into `less` and
`edit` unchanged; the kernel no longer links it at all. Had the terminal been a
byte stream this would have been an escape-sequence dialect instead, and §2.3
would have been paying for itself in the wrong direction.

**Both claims are the kernel's, not the program's.** `KeyClaim` and
`ScreenEnter` create a `KeyInput` and a `FullScreen` on the process's
kernel-side record, and `~Proc` destroys them. A killed tier-2 process runs no
destructor of its own, so a program that had taken the screen and then met `^C`
would otherwise leave the shell painting into a grid it does not own. The
destructor that does it is the one M8 already wrote for dropping the instance.

**The step protocol grew a token, which is the one place M9 was at risk.**
`chat` listens to a socket while it reads what is typed, so a process needed two
tasks, and two tasks need two syscalls outstanding. The process side was the
easy half — a four-slot waiter table, and `_resume` already took a token. The
kernel half was not: it had assumed one call per process, so `Sys::Stage` was
one reused buffer (the second call would overwrite the first before its server
read it) and the proxy task performed the syscall itself (a socket read that
never completes would have starved the keystroke behind it). So the staging
block moved into the call record, and the proxy split into a stepper and one
server job per call. The host now hears which call a step answers rather than
remembering the last, which is a small improvement in isolation on its own.

`chat` gets something back for it: as a binary its descriptors live exactly as
long as it does, so the receiver writes to stdout like anything else and
`chat > log` finally captures what arrives. As an applet it had to write to the
screen, because the pipe it would have used belonged to a job that might already
be freed.

**What the tests lost, and where it went.** The in-wasm suite cannot step an
instance, so with no applets left it can drive only the six builtins. That is
enough for more than it sounds — a builtin is an ordinary pipeline stage, so
`jobs | help` is a real two-stage pipeline, and the boot-cost guard and the
heap-leak check never needed a program at all. What it cannot do is watch a
program run: the filters, `^C` reaching a running pipeline, typing into a job's
stdin, `fg` waiting. All of that moved to `test/run.mjs`, where the stages are
the real binaries. The suite is a worse unit test and a better system test than
it was, and `test_prog.cpp` is gone.

**Smaller decisions.** The op word's upper bits became the operation's argument
rather than specifically a descriptor, so `open` carries its flags there and a
payload is only ever the operation's data; `PROC_ABI` went to 2 for it, which is
what the field is for. `Sys::Stage` is capped at 1 MiB — the largest blit there
can be — because a hostile binary may call it directly and an uncapped
`heap_alloc` is an interesting thing to hand one. `/bin` and `/share` are two
re-rooted views of the one bundle, so `BinFs` is deleted and `/usr` with it: M5
promised that when programs became binaries the mount would change and nothing
above it would, and that is how it read. `help` lists the builtins and then
`/bin`, taking its usage lines from `/share/help`, because the kernel no longer
holds a usage string for a program it has never run. And `src/bin/` became
`src/cmd/`: it holds C++ sources, and "bin" only ever distinguished it from
`src/prog/`.

## 0.1.0 — Packaging

`make release` packs `build/web/` into `build/braam-<version>.zip`. The version
string, which had read `0.1.0-m7` since M7 and predated two milestones, becomes
`0.1.0`: it names the archive now, so a stale one would be a stale release, not
merely a stale banner.

There was nothing to build. `build/web/` has been a complete deployment since M0
— every URL in it resolves against `import.meta.url`, so the tree works at any
path — and M7 made assembling it a target of its own. What was missing was one
archive to hand to a web host, and the whole of it is `tools/release.py` beside
`pack.py`, a custom target beside `serve`, and two lines of Makefile.

The archive nests under `braam-<version>/` rather than unpacking loose. A zip
that unpacks loose is unpackable only into a directory the deployer prepared and
named; a versioned one can be unpacked in a web root as it is, two releases
never collide on disk, and the directory says which one is serving. It costs the
deployer a `mv` when the URL must stay put, which is the smaller inconvenience
and a reversible one.

The version is read out of `src/kernel/version.h` by the script, at run time.
Reading it at configure time with `file(STRINGS)` was the obvious shape and is
wrong: editing a header does not re-run cmake, so the archive would go on
carrying the previous version until someone reconfigured — a silent error whose
symptom is a correct-looking file name.

Determinism is three lines — sort the entries, fix the timestamp at 1980-01-01,
fix the mode — and it buys the ability to answer "is what is deployed what I
built?" with `md5`. Without it two packs of one tree differ, so the question can
only be answered file by file after unpacking.

Nothing in the archive configures the server, and nothing needs to. Streaming
instantiation wants `application/wasm` and plenty of static hosts do not send
it, which `web/worker.js` has handled since M2 by falling back to a buffered
instantiate. That fallback is what makes "copy it anywhere" true, and it is why
there is no `.htaccess` in the zip to go stale against a host that never reads
it.

`LICENSE` travels with the site. The zip is a copy of the software in the sense
the MIT text means, and the notice is 1 KB.

## The milestones, and the criteria they were accepted against

The ten notes that follow are the *why* of M0–M9, one per milestone, written as
each landed. `doc/Milestones.md` was the plan they were written against — one
objective and a handful of acceptance criteria apiece, with a short note on how
each milestone departed from its plan. Every one of those departure notes is
stated at length below, and the arithmetic it carried (the size trajectory, the
program counts) is in the notes too, so what only it held was **the objectives
and the criteria**. Those are not history: a criterion is a standing behavioural
contract, and a change that breaks one is a regression however green the three
CTest cases are. So they are here, and the plan is deleted.

Twenty-two criteria, M0 to M9:

- **M0 — Nucleus.** Freestanding build, the coroutine shim, the allocator,
  `Str`/`Vec`, `host_log`, and a size budget from the first commit.
  - `make` produces a wasm binary with the Appendix C command line.
  - A static page loads a 4 KB wasm and logs a line to the console.
  - Size budget recorded (32 KiB) and enforced by CI.
- **M1 — Scheduler.** `Task<T>`, ready queue, wake tokens, `tick()`, `sleep_ms`,
  with `CancelToken` in every awaitable from here on.
  - Two coroutines interleave sleeps in the correct order.
  - Cancelling a sleeping task unwinds it and runs its destructors.
- **M2 — Screen and keys.** Cell grid, canvas renderer, damage rectangles,
  `Channel<Key>`, `OffscreenCanvas` transfer.
  - Typed characters appear on screen and the cursor moves.
  - Window resize reflows and `resize(cols, rows)` reaches the kernel.
- **M3 — Userland shell.** `LineEditor` with history and editing, tokeniser,
  program registry, argv, exit codes.
  - `echo hello` prints, `help` lists the programs.
  - Up-arrow recalls history; a nonzero exit code is observable.
- **M4 — Streams.** Stdio as channels, pipes, redirection, cancellation on `^C`.
  - `ls | grep foo` works.
  - `^C` interrupts a running pipeline and returns a prompt.
- **M5 — Filesystem.** Mount table, `MemFs`, `BundleFs` from a fetched archive,
  `OpfsFs` with the open-file table.
  - Write a file, reload the page, the file is still there.
  - `df` reports quota, usage, and ~~persistent versus best-effort mode~~ — the
    mode is on the boot banner now, since it is a property of the origin and not
    of a mount. **Amended**, not retired: see "df is a table".
  - ~~With OPFS unavailable, the system boots on `MemFs` and says so.~~
    **Retired**, not broken: there is no second store to boot on, and one that
    loses everything at the reload is the failure the criterion was written
    against. See "One store, and rootfs.zip".
- **M6 — Host services.** `fetch`, timers, WebSocket, clipboard, the `externref`
  table and `JsRef`.
  - A `curl`-ish command fetches a URL and prints the body.
  - A chat client works over a WebSocket.
  - `/mnt/import` and `export` move files in and out.
- **M7 — Depth.** A layout layer over the cell grid, job control, `/proc`-style
  introspection, an embedding API for host pages.
  - A full-screen editor opens, edits, and saves a file.
  - Jobs can be backgrounded and listed.
- **M8 — Isolated processes.** The §4.3 ABI, a `WebAssembly.Instance` per
  process, per-pid import closures, memory caps, a module cache, cross-boundary
  copies.
  - A program runs as its own instance with a 16 MB cap, and `memory.grow` fails
    past it.
  - A process cannot issue a syscall on behalf of another pid.
  - ~~Tier selection comes from binary metadata; userland behaviour is
    unchanged.~~ **Retired**, not broken: there is no selection left to come
    from anywhere. See "Tier 2 is deleted".
- **M9 — Liveness isolation.** A worker per process, `worker.terminate()` as
  `SIGKILL`, module `postMessage`.
  - `while(1){}` in an untrusted program is killable without reloading the page.
  - The shell stays responsive while such a program runs.

**Two changes since reach back through the whole list, and neither cost a
criterion.** The kernel applet and the program registry are gone, so where a
criterion says a program was registered that program is a binary in `/bin` and
`help` and `ls` read a filesystem — the criteria are about what the system
*does*, not where the code lives, and the ones that named `echo` and `sleep` as
applets are now met by binaries and checked by `test/run.mjs` rather than by the
in-wasm suite. And the tiers are gone, which retires exactly one criterion, M8's
third, as above.

**Where they are checked.** M0's budget is the `size` case and M1's pair is
checked twice — in `tests.wasm` against a fake clock and in `smoke` against the
shipping kernel. M5's persistence is mechanical too: `smoke` writes a file,
throws the instance away, builds a new one against the same JS-side store and
reads it back. Most of the rest are shell-level and much of what is scriptable
is driven by `test/run.mjs`; what is left — a resize reflowing, a chat between
two tabs, a picker moving a file in — is checked by hand at the prompt, which is
what a change touching one of them still owes.

---

## M9 — Liveness isolation

`while(1){}` is killable. A binary can ask to run in a Web Worker of its own,
and a process there is ended by `worker.terminate()` rather than by asking it to
stop — which is the one thing M8's isolation could not do, and the reason
Concept.md §4.2 exists. 236,965 bytes of `kernel.wasm` against an unchanged 256
KiB budget: **93 bytes**, which is the headline.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places — the §3 diagram, §4's tier prose, §4.2,
§4.3 and §4.4, and Appendix B — and none of them is structural.

### The ABI did not have to move, and that is the whole result

The obvious reading of M8's §4.3 is that tier 3 breaks it. `sys` is synchronous
and returns a value; a worker boundary has no synchronous direction, because §1
rules out `SharedArrayBuffer` and therefore `Atomics.wait`. The conclusion looks
like "tier 3 needs a second ABI", which would have meant two process runtimes,
two sets of binaries, and a tier that userland could see.

It does not, because the question is not *how does a process reach the kernel
synchronously from another thread* but *does it have to reach the kernel at
all*. Taken one at a time, none of the four synchronous calls does. `GetPid` is
a constant the host already binds into the closure. `Now` is a clock, and a
clock reading shipped with the step plus the worker's own elapsed time is a
better answer than a round trip would be. `Exit` is issued by `status_of`
immediately before returning, so buffering it onto the step's reply is not
merely equivalent, it is exact — tier 2 keeps the last `Exit` before the step
returned, and so does this. And `Stage` is not a program's syscall at all: it
exists so the *host* can ask for somewhere to copy into, and at tier 3 the host
doing the asking is the kernel's worker, which is on the kernel's thread.

So `src/proc/`, `src/cmd/` and the four exports are untouched, the same
`wc.wasm` runs at either tier, and the smoke test asserts one binary per tier
against the same import and export lists. The protocol between the two workers
is the *host's*, not an ABI: both halves of it live in `web/proc.js`, and
`web/procworker.js` is ten lines of wiring with no logic to drift.

`Stage` is answered `0` rather than assumed unreachable. A tier-3 process is the
untrusted one by definition, and "no program calls this" is not a property of a
binary somebody else compiled. Zero is the "no room" answer `proc_syscall`
already turns into `NoMemory`, so a binary that calls it gets a defined answer
instead of a hole. Unknown operations are refused locally for the same reason,
and never relayed.

### One message per step, not four

The first sketch had `sys_async` and `Sys::Exit` each post their own message,
arguing that a message port is FIFO so the kernel would see them in the right
order. It would have worked and it was still wrong: a suspension is *always*
immediately preceded by exactly one `sys_async` (there is one outstanding call
and `_resume` returns right after it), and `Exit` only ever precedes a return.
Both therefore fit on the reply to the step that caused them. Two messages per
syscall instead of four, no ordering argument to get right, and the kernel-side
relay is straight-line code in one handler — the same two lines as M8's
`sys_async` closure, with the source of the bytes changed.

### The kill needed no kernel code

M8 wrote that a tier-2 stage is a `Task<i32>` like any other and that the
destructor is the whole kill path. That turned out to be literally true across a
thread boundary as well: `^C` cancels the proxy, `~End` calls `proc_kill`, and
the host terminates a worker instead of dropping a Map entry. `jobs`, `kill %n`,
`/proc`, the tty pump and the stage epilogue needed nothing, and the kernel diff
is three edits — one line of `exec.cpp`, a tier argument on `proc_spawn`, and
four inline helpers in `sysabi.h`.

The one thing that *did* need writing is easy to miss and would have leaked
forever: **the in-flight step must be failed when the worker is terminated.** An
abandoned `HostReq` is freed by `host_orphan_reply` from `wake()`, and `wake()`
only happens if somebody answers — so a request whose worker no longer exists
has to be answered by the code that killed it. At tier 2 this happens for free,
because a queued step still runs and finds the pid gone.

Two smaller cases of the same shape: a worker that errors marks its process
crashed and drops its own link, so `kill` cannot hand a dead worker to the next
process; and `kill` after a *normal* exit is not a kill at all, because `exec`
kills every process it spawned, including the ones that exited. That is where
the finished worker goes back to the pool.

### The pool is the capability probe

Nested workers are not universal, and Concept.md already promised that a binary
asking for tier 3 runs at tier 2 where there is no worker for it. Making that
promise good needed somewhere to find out, and the pool was already going to
exist: one worker is hired at boot with no process in it, so a `Worker`
constructor that throws throws at boot rather than under the first `exec`, and
the first `exec` of a tier-3 binary costs an instantiation rather than a worker
start.

The pool saves worker startup and not memory — a process's sixteen megabytes go
when its instance does, not when its worker is recycled — which is worth saying
because the opposite is the natural assumption. Idle workers are capped at two.

### The tier on the wire, and the alternative not taken

`HostRequest` had no room: `flags` held both page counts and `aux` is the pid,
which is the one field that must not share. The tier went into the top nibble of
`flags`, with `proc_pack` / `proc_initial` / `proc_max` / `proc_tier` in
`sysabi.h` and a `static_assert` that the page counts still fit — the same shape
as `sys_op`'s descriptor packing, and mirrored in `web/proc.js` as `abi.js`
already mirrors `HostRequest`.

The tempting alternative was to let the host read the tier out of the `braam`
custom section itself, which it can: it holds the module, and
`WebAssembly.Module.customSections` is right there. Two ends reading the same
bytes provably cannot disagree. It was rejected because §4 says *`exec`* picks
the tier, and a host that picked it independently would leave the kernel unable
to say what it got — and the kernel is the thing that has to report `126` or
`132`.

### `spin`, and a loop the compiler was entitled to delete

`spin` exists to be un-killable by cooperation, and the first version of it did
not spin at all: an infinite loop with no side effects is not required to make
progress, and clang deletes it. A `volatile` counter is the fix and the comment
above it is the point of the file. `spin N` runs a bounded number of turns and
exits, so the tier's ordinary path — instantiate, write, exit — has a program
that exercises it without waiting for a kill.

`tail` moved to tier 3 as well, which is how the protocol is *checked* rather
than argued: `tail -n 1 /usr/share/motd | wc` is M8's own assertion, unedited,
now a tier-3 process feeding a tier-2 one through a kernel pipe. It buys that
coverage at 0.1 ms per 512-byte chunk, which is the tier's standing cost and the
reason it is a claim a binary makes rather than a default.

### What CI proves, and what it cannot

`test/run.mjs` is a straight-line synchronous driver — microtasks do not run
during it, which is why `step()` grew an explicit completion callback and lost
its promise. A real thread does not fit that at all, so `test/fakeworker.mjs`
wires the two halves of the protocol back to back over queues the driver pumps.
The whole protocol runs in CI: bind, step, the syscall relay, the exit status,
the pool, and the tier-2 fallback. Only the thread is fake.

Which means the one thing CI cannot prove is preemption, since Node is as
single-threaded as the kernel's worker. So a looping program is *modelled*: a
held step is one that sits undelivered, which is precisely and completely what
the kernel sees of a real one — no reply, no timer, and nothing to cancel but
the proxy. The assertions on top of that are the two acceptance criteria: `^C`
on a held process leaves `[130]`, terminates exactly one worker and leaves no
instance behind; and with one held in the background, `echo` and `jobs` still
answer.

The real thread was checked by hand, driving the shipping `web/procworker.js`
from `node:worker_threads`: `{k:"ready"}` on load, a bind and a step returning
`SUSPENDED` with a write of `spin: pid 7, spinning` — which is `GetPid` answered
inside the worker with the pid the host bound — then the reply that sends it
into its loop, no answer, and `terminate()` returning in 2 ms. That is the
criterion, once, outside a browser.

`dispose()` gained a handshake for the same reason. It used to terminate the
kernel's worker outright; a nested worker is specified to go with its parent,
but a leaked one is a core spinning for the life of the page, which is too much
to leave to a spec this code cannot check. The page now says so first and
terminates on the next turn as the backstop.

---

## M8 — Isolated processes

A program can now be a binary of its own, in a `WebAssembly.Instance` of its
own, with an address space, an `externref` table, a file-descriptor table and
sixteen megabytes that belong to nobody else — and the shell, the pipes, `^C`,
`jobs` and `/proc` do not know the difference. 236,872 bytes of `kernel.wasm`
against an unchanged 256 KiB budget, plus three binaries of 6–17 KB each.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places: §3.4 (two new exports and the record's
new word), §4 (tier selection, and what the unit tests can drive), §4.3 (the ABI
as built), §4.4 (the compile is not streaming) and Appendix B (how the copy
actually gets its destination).

### The rule the whole design turns on

**The kernel never calls a process, and the host never calls one while the
kernel is on the stack.** Everything else here follows from that sentence.

The first half is not a choice: wasm has no instruction that reaches another
instance, so only JS can call `_start`. The second half is: JS *could* call
`_start` from inside `host_svc`, the way `test/fakefs.mjs` answers a storage
request from inside the import — and that works there precisely because a reply
only queues. A process step is not a reply. It runs a program, and that program
immediately calls back in through `sys`, which allocates, touches the process
table and wakes a token. Doing that on top of a half-finished
`HostCall::issue()` is a class of bug that would show up as heap corruption
weeks later.

So one `_start` or `_resume` is a deferred host action, structurally identical
to a storage reply: the kernel's proxy task parks on a wake token, the host
steps the instance once the tick has unwound, and wakes the token with the
outcome. In `web/worker.js` that deferral is a microtask; in the test driver it
is an explicit `drain()` between ticks; the stepping code itself is the same
`web/proc.js` in both, because the difference is scheduling and not behaviour.

Synchronous syscalls run the other way and need none of this. `sys(pid, …)`
re-enters the kernel from JS at top level, exactly as `key()` and `wake()` do,
and answers without parking.

### The proxy task is the entire cancellation story

A tier-2 stage is a `Task<i32>` like any other. It spawns the instance, then
loops: step, and when the step reports "suspended", perform the syscall the
process is parked on and step again with the answer. The syscall is performed
*by the proxy, in kernel-land*, with the proxy's own `CancelToken`, against the
`Stdio` the job gave it — so a write into a full pipe is `Stream::Write`, a read
at end of input is `Source::Read`, and `^C` reaches a process through exactly
the awaitables it reaches an applet through.

That is why M8 adds nothing to the job runtime, the job table, `/proc` or the
tty pump. It is also why the destructor is the whole kill path: cancelling the
proxy unwinds it, and `~End` tells the host to drop the instance. A killed
process never unwinds — its coroutine frames, its heap and its descriptors go at
once, which is the isolation working rather than a shortcut. That is a strictly
better kill than an applet gets, and still not a *liveness* kill: a process in a
loop between syscalls is M9's problem, and nothing here changes that.

### No new import, two new exports

M5 fixed the style at one import per calling convention and M6 held to it.
Spawning, stepping and killing are asynchronous host operations with a request
record, which is `host_svc` exactly, so they are three more of its operations.
§2.2 still sanctions two synchronous exceptions and there are still six imports.

The two new exports are not the host's business at all: they are the process's
`sys` and `sys_async`, forwarded with a pid. That indirection is the capability
system §4.1 promised, and it is twelve lines of `web/proc.js` — the closure is
built per instantiation with the pid written into it, so *process 7 holds no
function that says 3*. The second acceptance criterion is not a check that runs;
it is a shape the ABI has, and what the smoke test asserts is the shape: the
module's imports are `env.memory`, `kernel.sys`, `kernel.sys_async`, and `sys`
has no argument a pid could go in.

`HostRequest` gained one word, `aux`. The alternative was to overload `flags`
and write the page counts into `result_lo` on the way *out*, which would have
made a reply field an argument field and saved four bytes.

### Memory is imported, so the cap is the kernel's

`-Wl,--max-memory=16777216` would also make `memory.grow` fail at 16 MB, and it
would be the *binary's* number. `--import-memory` with no declared maximum puts
it the other way round: the module says only what it needs to start with, and
the host supplies `new WebAssembly.Memory({initial, maximum: 256})`. A binary
cannot ask for more by being compiled differently. That is what §4.1 means by an
rlimit without cgroups, and `hog` is in `src/cmd/` to demonstrate it: it takes
64 KiB at a time until the allocator says no, gives one span back so it has
somewhere to put the coroutine frames that report the answer, and asks
`memory.grow` for one more page.

### The metadata is stamped after the link, not compiled in

`exec` reads the tier out of a `braam` custom section, which was to be a
`__attribute__((section(".custom_section.braam")))` global. It never reached the
object file — `used` keeps the compiler from dropping it but does not make it a
custom section here — and rather than fight the toolchain, `tools/stamp.py`
appends the section after the link.

That turned out to be the better place anyway. The section carries
`initial_pages`, which has to agree with `-Wl,--initial-memory`, and the stamper
is invoked from the same four lines of `src/cmd/CMakeLists.txt` that set the
link flag. A number that must match another number should be written once.

### What the port of `wc` and `tail` proves, and what stopped `echo`

The third criterion is "userland behaviour is unchanged", and the honest way to
check it is to move a program and leave its tests alone. `wc` and `tail` moved
to `/usr/bin`; `echo 'a b' | wc` still prints `1 2 4`, `wc < notes` still prints
`2 2 8`, and `curl /hello.txt | wc` still prints `1 2 9` — M4's, M5's and M6's
assertions, unedited, now running an instance through a pipe, a redirection and
a fetched body.

`echo` and `sleep` were meant to move as well, and could not. The in-wasm unit
tests drive both — `echo` is `test_shell`'s workhorse and `sleep` is
`test_jobs`'s only timer — and `tests.wasm` cannot run a tier-2 program *at
all*: stepping an instance means returning to the host, and `run_tests()`
returns to the host exactly once, at the end. Porting them would have meant
rewriting two of the load-bearing unit tests around programs chosen to suit the
harness, which is the tail wagging the dog. The constraint is real and general,
so it is written into §4 rather than left as a note here: whatever `test/unit/`
runs has to stay an applet.

Two assertions in `test_shell` did have to move off `wc`, and both got better
for it: one now checks a pipeline by its output rather than by counting it, and
the other checked a hand-maintained count of programs whose names contain an
`e`.

### The syscall table, and the isolation this does not buy

Eight calls: `exit`, `getpid`, `now` and `stage` synchronously, `write`, `read`,
`open` and `close` asynchronously. Every one has a caller in `src/cmd/`; a
`sleep` syscall was written and then removed when `sleep` stayed an applet,
because a syscall nothing calls is an ABI nothing tests.

`stage` is the odd one, and it is the host's rather than a program's: the kernel
cannot be handed a buffer it did not allocate, so before copying a payload
across the closure asks for one. That is Appendix B's `Uint8Array.set` plus the
one thing Appendix B did not mention.

A descriptor is an index into the process's own table, so a number one process
holds means nothing in another. Paths are not: `open` resolves against the one
global cwd with the kernel's full authority, so M8 isolates address space,
memory and descriptors, and does not isolate the namespace. Fixing that needs a
per-process root and a cwd that is not a global, which is a milestone's worth of
work in the VFS and not a line in the dispatcher.

### Smaller decisions

- **`panic` is out of line now**, and takes `(ptr, len)` rather than a `Str`. A
  process has no host imports to log through, so it needs a different
  definition, which means the inline one had to go. The first version took a
  `Str` and cost 2,812 bytes: the wasm ABI passes an eight-byte struct
  indirectly, and there are a hundred call sites. Two scalars cost 55.
- **`stage()` in the job runtime takes a built `Task<i32>`** rather than a
  `Program *`, because a tier-2 body needs its pid and `sched_spawn` only hands
  one back once the task exists. The pid goes into the `Executable` the job
  owns, and the proxy reads it at its first resume — a tick later, since a
  `Task` is lazy.
- **The scheduler's name for a stage is `argv[0]`**, not `Program::name`, which
  a binary does not have. It is a view into the job's word store, which outlives
  every stage.
- **`help` lists `/usr/bin` too.** A program need not be in the registry to be a
  program, and what tier a name runs at is not something the listing should say.
- **A binary is re-read from the VFS on every `exec`.** The host caches the
  compiled `Module` by path, which is the expensive half, but the bytes still
  cross the VFS and one copy into the request record each time. Caching those
  too wants an invalidation story, and `/usr` being read-only is not one that
  generalises.
- **The bundle is staged rather than packed in place.** The binaries are build
  outputs and `/usr/bin/wc` has to be a plain name, so `build/bundle/` is a copy
  of `bundle/` with `bin/<name>` added, and that is what `tools/pack.py` packs.

## M7 — Depth

A program can take the whole screen and give it back, a job can outlive the
prompt that started it, the scheduler can be read as files, and a host page can
put a terminal on itself in six lines. Five new commands, one new library, and —
the part worth stating first — **no ABI change at all**: no new import, no new
export, and `test/run.mjs`'s exact-surface assertion is untouched. 225,784 bytes
of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in four places: §3.5 (the layout layer, the keyboard
claim, the saved screen, and re-wrap deferred), §3.6 (the job table, and the
scheduler's names), §5.1 (`/proc`) and §7 (`src/ui/`).

### One receiver, so the pump routes rather than yields

`Channel` has one receiver and a second suspended receiver silently displaces
the first. While a pipeline runs, that receiver is `tty_pump`, and the shell's
handshake at the end of `run_line` — cancel the pump, wait for its report —
depends on it. An editor that simply did `co_await keys().recv()` would displace
the pump, take `^C` with it, and race that handshake. The bug would not look
like a bug; it would look like the keyboard occasionally going dead.

So a full-screen program does not receive keys, it **claims a route through the
pump**: `KeyInput` gives it raw keys with the echo and the line discipline
turned off, and the pump `try_send`s into its ring. One mechanism covers three
cases that looked unrelated at the start of the milestone — the editor, the
pager, and `fg`, which needs the *cooked* bytes to go to a different job's stdin
and gets `InputClaim` for it.

`^C` is deliberately not routed. An editor could reasonably want it, but a
program that has taken the entire screen and stopped answering must stay
killable by the key that kills everything, and that is M4's acceptance criterion
as much as it is a safety rule. `edit` quits with `^Q` for the same reason, and
^C throws the buffer away.

The claim is RAII, which is what gives the route back when a claimant is killed
rather than asking it to be polite. M7 made it restore whatever was in force
before, on the reasoning that claims should nest; that was wrong, and "One
claimant, named by pid" above says why and replaces it with a single holder that
refuses the second.

### The single waiting slot decides the shape of `less` and of `fg`

`CancelState::waiting` is one slot, so a task cannot be parked on a pipe and on
the keyboard at once. This is the same constraint that pushed pipelines into
independent scheduler jobs in M4, and it shows up twice more here.

`less` therefore reads its input to end-of-input *before* it paints anything. A
real pager is lazy, and this one cannot be without becoming two coroutines and a
refcounted shared block — the `chat` pattern, which is 100 lines and a class of
lifetime bugs to buy laziness nobody asked for in a tab. It does claim the
keyboard first, before reading, so that what is typed while a slow pipe fills is
queued for the pager instead of being echoed at the shell.

`fg` never awaits keys at all. It parks on the adopted job's completion token
and lets the pump do the routing, which means ^C cancels *`fg`* — and `fg`'s
destructor passes that on to the job it adopted. Cancellation propagating
through a destructor rather than a branch is the same trick `run_line` and
`chat` use, for the third time.

### A background job is the same `Job`, with the reaper in the shell's place

`Job` was already a refcounted heap block, already outliving the frames that
point at it, already carrying its own `done` channel — M4 built it that way for
a different reason, and backgrounding needed almost none of it changed. What a
background job needs is somebody to stand where `run_line` stands: collect the
reports, record the status, drop the last reference. That is `reaper`, forty
lines.

Three details are not obvious. `CancelAll` gained an `armed` flag rather than a
branch around it, because it must still fire when setup fails partway. The
command text is *copied* into the table entry — `run_line` receives a `Str` into
the shell frame's line buffer, which is gone before `jobs` ever runs. And the
entry holds a reference of its own, because `fg` and `kill` reach the pipes and
the pids through it long after the shell moved on.

A background job gets no pump and its stdin is closed at once. Giving it the
keyboard would mean deciding which of several running jobs a keystroke belongs
to, which is what a foreground group is for; end-of-input is what a shell does
with `&` anyway.

There is no `bg` and no `^Z`. Suspending a running coroutine at an arbitrary
point is the resume-side twin of `CancelToken`: every awaitable would have to
consult a stop flag and every awaitable would have to be resumable without an
event. That is a milestone, not a command, and a stub that only ever printed
"not supported" would be worse than its absence.

Finished jobs are announced by the shell before the next prompt rather than
wherever they happen to end, which would otherwise land in the middle of a line
being typed. It is a coroutine of its own so that its locals stay out of
`shell()`'s frame, which has a size class to fit inside — the same reason
`boot_filesystem` is one.

### `Pane` writes cells, so the kernel grew `screen_touch`

`screen_cells()` has been public since M2 and writing through it marked nothing
damaged, so the renderer would not have repainted what a pane wrote. The
alternative was to route every pane write through `screen_put`, which moves the
global cursor, defers wrapping, and scrolls the whole grid when it reaches the
bottom — three behaviours a clipped rectangle must not have. One new function is
the smaller change, and `screen_touch(x, y, w, h)` is what any later direct
writer will want too.

A pane fills with blank cells — codepoint 0 — rather than spaces, since 0 is
what the grid means by empty and it still carries the pane's colours; that is
what makes a reversed status line one `fill_row` rather than a loop of spaces.

`FullScreen` copies the grid to a heap block and copies it back from its
destructor. If the geometry changed while the program ran, it clears instead:
the snapshot describes a grid that no longer exists, and pasting it back would
be worse than blanking. That path is tested, because it is exactly what a window
resize during `edit` does.

### `/proc` is flat, and generated at open

`BinFs` set the pattern in M5 and `ProcFs` follows it: a generated read-only
filesystem, so `cat` and `grep` are the introspection tools and there is no
second interface to keep in step with the first.

Two departures from Linux. The tree is flat — `/proc/42` is a file, not a
directory — because a process here has one line of state and a directory level
would hold exactly one file; if a process ever grows `cmdline`, `cwd` and `fds`,
that is the moment to add the level. And content is produced at `open` into a
heap block that the descriptor owns, so a file read in two blocks cannot
describe two different moments. `BinFs` could regenerate per read because a
usage line never changes; `meminfo` changes on every allocation, including the
ones `cat` itself makes.

The scheduler had to give up a little: a `Str name` on its private job record,
set at `sched_spawn`, and a `sched_procs` snapshot. The name is a view, so it
must outlive the task — a literal or a `Program::name`, never a local — and the
header says so. `sched_procs` returns nothing while `tearing_down` is set, for
the reason `find_job` does: `jobs[]` holds freed pointers while `~Sched` walks
it.

### The embedding API is an extraction, not an invention

`index.html` had 190 lines of module in it and nothing there could be imported.
Everything below it was already dependency-injected — `makeFsImports`,
`makeSvcImport`, `makeImports` all take their backends as arguments, which is
what the test fakes have been proving since M5 — so the page was the only layer
that was not.

`web/braam.js` exports one function, `mount({canvas, ...})`, returning a handle
with `focus()` and `dispose()`. The keyboard listener moved from `window` to the
canvas, which is the one behavioural change: an embedded terminal shares its
page, and two of them must not both read the same keystroke. `dispose()` exists
because a host that swaps views has to be able to let go — it terminates the
worker and drops every listener and observer.

The worker stays one kernel per worker. That is not a limitation to fix later;
it is the isolation model M8 builds on, and two terminals on a page are two
workers that share nothing but the origin's storage. `web/embed.html` runs
exactly that, with a different palette on the right-hand one to show that a
theme is an embedder's choice.

`E_PERM`/`E_IO`, which the page had been re-declaring as literals, now come from
`abi.js` like everything else on the wire.

### What the browser found, that no test could

The unit cases and the smoke test drive `kernel.wasm`; nothing drives the
shipping page. So the embedding API was checked in a real browser — headless
Firefox, a page reporting back through the HTTP log, and a screenshot taken
after a deliberately slow subresource delayed the load event. Two defects came
out of it, both older than M7 and neither reachable from Node.

**Boot waited on `navigator.storage.persist()`, which is not always quick.** M6
chose to block on it, reasoning that reporting the wrong durability is worse
than a tick of delay. That is right about the trade and wrong about the number:
Firefox took over five seconds to answer, and boot waited the whole time behind
a blank canvas. The page now sends a provisional best-effort answer after a 250
ms grace period and the real answer when it arrives, and the late one corrects
`OpfsStore.persisted` rather than boot — so `df` is right from the moment the
browser decides. With two terminals on a page it was worse than slow: a second
`persist()` issued while the first is outstanding did not settle until the first
had, so the second kernel never booted at all. Persistence belongs to the
origin, so the request is now made once per page.

**`build/web/` went stale on a web-only edit.** Assembling it was a `POST_BUILD`
step of the `kernel` target, so changing nothing but a `.js` file left
`make serve` serving the previous copy — which is exactly how the first defect
was nearly missed, since the fix under test was not the code being served. It is
its own always-run target now.

### Two things that did not land

**Re-wrapping logical lines on resize.** §3.5 promised it to "the layout layer
in M7", and the layout layer is the wrong place for it: re-wrapping needs to
know which rows are continuations of the row above, which is a bit `screen_put`
must set as it writes — inside the grid, below everything a pane can see. It
also collides with `LineEditor`'s anchor arithmetic, which infers scrolls by
comparing where a write should have ended against `cursor_y`. Doing it properly
is scrollback's problem and it will arrive with scrollback.

**A pane of `chat`'s own.** M6's notes said the layout layer is where an
interactive program gets one. It is, but only for a program that owns the
foreground: `chat`'s receiver is a detached task that outlives its parent, and
painting into a pane whose owner is gone is the same use-after-free as writing
into a pipe whose `Job` is gone. It still writes to the screen.

## M6 — Host services

The tab reaches outside itself: HTTP, WebSocket, the clipboard, the user's own
disk, and a clock that can name a day. Seven new commands, one new import, one
new export, and the `externref` table Concept.md §3.7 has been promising since
M0. 181,545 bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in six places: §2.2 (no third synchronous exception, and
why the new export is not one), §3.4 (`host_fetch` becomes `host_svc`, and `ref`
joins the exports), §3.7 (the table is real, and it points the other way), §5.1
(`/mnt/import`, and the bundle stays an archive), §5.4 (the escape hatch exists)
and §7 (`src/svc/`).

### The table is deposited into, not read out of

§3.7 described "a `WebAssembly.Table` of `externref` that wasm indexes into and
JS populates". Half of that is wrong, and the half that is wrong is the half
about JS.

`__externref_t` and the `__builtin_wasm_table_*` builtins work exactly as hoped
— reference-types is on by default for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, so a
`static __externref_t table[0]` compiles and links with no extra flag. What does
not work is getting JS to that table: `import_module` and `import_name` are
function attributes, and clang rejects them on a table outright. An imported
table is not available, and exporting the module's own table means teaching
wasm-ld to export a table symbol.

Neither is needed, because an import may take an `externref` *parameter* and an
export may take one too. So the traffic runs the other way and JS never touches
the table at all:

- The kernel reserves a slot before it issues the request, and puts the number
  in the record.
- The host resolves its promise and calls `ref(slot, obj)`, the one new export.
- To use the object later, the kernel reads the slot and passes it as
  `host_svc`'s fourth argument. The host is handed the object; it never asks for
  it.

This is better than the sketch rather than merely equivalent. A host that cannot
index the table cannot reach an object the kernel did not deliberately pass out,
which is the property §4.1 wants from per-instance tables in M8 — and it comes
for free, since a module-defined table is part of the instance.

`ref` is an export, so §2.2 is untouched: the rule is about imports returning
data, and this returns nothing.

### One request record, two interfaces

A service call needs precisely what M5 built for storage: a heap-owned record
that outlives a cancelled awaiter, an orphan list, the two-phase reply for a
variable-sized answer, and the register-then-issue ordering in `await_suspend`.
Writing a second copy of it would have been about 150 lines, a second orphan
list, a second reaper chained off `wake()`, and a second `Request` class in JS.

So `FsRequest`/`FsReq`/`FsCall` moved to `src/kernel/hostcall.h` as
`HostRequest`/`HostReq`/ `HostCall`, tagged with a `HostIface` that picks the
import in `issue()`, and `FsCall` and `SvcCall` are one-line subclasses that
name the op enum. `path_ptr`/`path_len` became `arg_ptr`/`arg_len`, because a
URL and a clipboard string are not paths. `web/abi.js` is the same move:
`Request`, the field table, the error numbering and `statusOf` now live there,
and `fs.js` and `svc.js` both import them.

The risk in a refactor like this is that it quietly breaks the cancellation path
nobody looks at. `test_hostfs` is exactly that test and it did not move, which
is the reason to do the refactor in the same milestone rather than the next one.

The record gained one word, `ref`, and the ownership question that comes with
it. A borrowed slot — `WsSend` naming a socket the caller holds — is just a
number. A slot the *reply* fills is owned by the record, not by the frame:
`reserve_ref()` puts a `JsRef` inside `HostReq`, so a request cancelled before
it is issued frees the slot along with the record, and one cancelled after it is
issued keeps the slot alive at the address the host still holds. `test_svc`
exists for that one case.

### No `host_svc_sync`

The wall clock is the near miss. `Date.now()` is as synchronous as
`performance.now()`, and a `host_clock()` import would have been three lines. It
would also have been §2.2's third exception, and the section says plainly that
at three it stops being pragmatism.

Making it an operation on the asynchronous ABI costs one round trip in a program
that runs once and prints a line. That is the right trade every time, and the
fact that it was even tempting is why the rule is written down.

### Two waits mean two jobs, and the child outlives the parent

`chat` reads the keyboard and the socket at once. `CancelState::waiting` is a
single slot, so that is two jobs — the same conclusion M4 reached for pipeline
stages, and the second place §3.6's structured concurrency is put back by hand
from a destructor.

What is new is that the child can outlive the parent. `run_line`'s `CancelAll`
cancels its stages, but a cancelled coroutine does not unwind until the
scheduler resumes it, which is a tick or two later. In M4 that was harmless: the
pump holds a reference to the refcounted `Job`, so everything it touches is
alive for as long as it is. `chat`'s receiver has no such handle — a program is
given a `Stream`, not the thing that owns the pipe behind it. Cancel `chat` in
`chat url | tee log` and the receiver could wake up to write into a pipe whose
`Job` has already been freed.

So the receiver touches nothing the parent owns: the session is refcounted and
holds the socket, and incoming lines go to `screen_write` — a global, like
`boot.cpp`'s diagnostics. The cost is that `chat > log` does not capture what
arrives. For an interactive program that is close to right anyway, and M7's
layout layer is where a program gets a pane of its own.

This is the second time a child-group awaitable would have made the problem
disappear. It needs intrusive queue links in `Waiter` first, which is the same
work a channel with two blocked senders needs; the note in CLAUDE.md stands,
with one more reason behind it.

### CORS is the first wall, so `curl` says so

A relative URL resolves against the page, which is why `curl /index.html` works
with no network at all and why the acceptance criterion can be met offline.
Anything cross-origin needs the server to send `access-control-allow-origin`,
and `fetch` reports a CORS refusal and a dead network identically, as a
`TypeError` with nothing in it.

That reaches the kernel as `Error::Io`, and "curl: https://…: i/o error" would
send someone looking at their connection. The diagnostic appends "(a
cross-origin URL needs CORS)" on `Io` and nothing else, which is the one hint
that is right most of the time.

### The clipboard, the picker and the download live on the page

Three of the thirteen operations cannot happen in a worker:
`navigator.clipboard` is main-thread only, `<input type="file">` and an
`<a download>` click need the DOM. `web/svc.js` keeps a map of pending ids and
relays those three to the page over `postMessage`.

None of that is visible from the kernel, which is the point of §2.2: a service
operation is a token whether the answer comes from `fetch` in the worker or from
a file picker two threads away. The picker opens inside the transient activation
of the keystroke that ran the command, so `import` needs no button of its own;
the page reads each file with `arrayBuffer()` and posts the bytes down, so the
slot holds a plain array and reading a file back needs no further relay.

### Reading the clipboard needs a gesture the command cannot have

`pbpaste` failed in a browser with "permission denied", and the reason is not a
bug that can be fixed where it appeared. `navigator.clipboard.readText()` is
only permitted from inside a user-gesture handler. Our request reaches the page
over `postMessage`, which is to say after the keystroke's handler has returned —
so the call is *never* inside a gesture, no matter how promptly it arrives.
Safari refuses outright, Firefox does not expose the API to page content, and
Chrome prompts. `pbcopy` is unaffected because `writeText()` is far more
permissive.

Transient activation would not have saved it either: the five-second window
governs things a page *initiates*, and a clipboard read is checked against the
handler it is in.

The escape is that a **paste is the gesture**. The `paste` event delivers the
text with no permission at all, everywhere. So `ClipWait` is a fourteenth
operation: `pbpaste` tries `clip_read()`, and on `Perm` prints "press ⌘V or
ctrl-V to paste" on stderr and parks until the page's `paste` listener answers.
Where `readText()` is allowed, nothing is printed and nothing changes.

Three details fall out of it. `Ctrl+V` joined the reserved set in `web/keys.js`,
since a keystroke the kernel eats produces no `paste` event — on macOS `⌘V` was
already left alone, because `consumes()` never claims a `metaKey` chord. The
held-text buffer in `web/svc.js` exists because the reply is sized twice like
any other, and a paste cannot be asked for again: the same shape as a WebSocket
message waiting at the head of its queue. And `^C` while parked is the ordinary
orphan path — the page's waiter stays armed, the eventual paste replies to a
token nothing waits on, and `host_orphan_reply` reaps the record; the smoke test
walks exactly that.

### A response body streams; a message does not

Two reply shapes, for two different unknowns. A response body is read with
`writeSome` — as much as fits in a 512-byte buffer, with the host keeping the
remainder — because a body has no size worth asking about and 512 bytes is the
allocator's top size class (§8.2). A WebSocket message uses the two-phase reply
instead, because a message is atomic: splitting one across two reads would lose
the boundary that makes it a message.

The retry that the two-phase reply implies is why a `Fetch` reply deposits its
object *before* reporting the header size. A retry arrives with the object
already in the slot, so the host skips the request and only rewrites the headers
— otherwise asking for more room would issue the fetch a second time.

### Proving the browser half without a browser

`test/fakesvc.mjs` mirrors `test/fakefs.mjs`: canned routes, a loopback socket,
a clipboard variable, a fixed set of picked files, all answered from inside the
import. That covers the kernel, and it deliberately does not cover `web/svc.js`,
which is the code a user actually runs.

So `tools/wsd.mjs` is a real WebSocket server — the RFC 6455 handshake and frame
codec in about a hundred lines of dependency-free Node — and `make serve` starts
it beside the static server. Two tabs running `chat ws://localhost:8081` talk to
each other with no internet, which is what the second criterion means and what
the loopback fake cannot show.

### Smaller decisions

- **`/mnt/import` is a directory, not a mount.** The picker hands over bytes. A
  read-through `Fs` over `File` objects would exercise `JsRef` more thoroughly
  and would not make `cat` work any better.
- **`Drop` is fire-and-forget.** Releasing a slot is not enough on its own: an
  open socket is held alive by its own event handlers on the JS side. `JsHandle`
  says so out loud, with a token-less `host_svc` call from its destructor, which
  is also what closes the socket when `^C` destroys the frame holding it.
- **`E` gained `CANCELLED`, `AGAIN` and `CLOSED`.** `web/fs.js` listed only the
  values it reported; a socket that has gone away needs `Closed` to mean EOF to
  a reader, as it does for a pipe.
- **`date` carries its own calendar.** Twenty lines of `civil_from_days` rather
  than asking the host to format, which would have put a locale in the ABI. `-u`
  prints UTC; without it the offset comes back from the host in the reply's
  `flags`, biased by 1440 to stay unsigned.
- **`export` buffers the whole file.** A download is one Blob, so there is
  nothing to stream into.
- **The `help` grid grew.** Twenty-seven programs no longer fit twenty-four
  rows, so `test_prog` and the smoke test both resize before checking `help`.
  That the assertion needed changing at all is the tripwire working.

## M5 — Filesystem

A mount table, four filesystems, an open-file table, redirection that reaches
real files, and seven new commands. This is the first milestone whose state
outlives the tab, which is what makes it the first one where getting the
boundary wrong loses a user's work rather than a frame. 137,867 bytes of
`kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

`Concept.md` is amended in five places, because five decisions here differ from
what it said: §3.4's import list, §3.6's `Fs` sketch, §3.7's `externref` table,
§5.1's mount layering and §5.3's capability struct. Each is argued below.

### Two imports, not ten

Storage needs roughly ten operations. Concept.md §3.4 listed `host_storage_read`
and `host_storage_write`, which suggests one named import per operation, and
that is what the naive reading of §2.2 wants: an import is a syscall, so name
it.

The trouble is that the smoke test asserts `kernel.wasm`'s *exact* import list,
deliberately — it is how an accidental libc dependency is caught at link time
rather than as a runtime trap. Ten named imports means that assertion churns on
every operation added, and the churn is noise: nothing about `host_fs_truncate`
appearing is a fact anyone needs to review. What is worth reviewing is a new
*calling convention*, and there are exactly two of those.

So: `host_fs(op, token, req)` for everything asynchronous, and
`host_fs_sync(op, handle, ptr, len, off) -> i32` for §5.2's sanctioned
exception. That is also the shape §4.3 already fixes for the M8 process ABI —
`sys` and `sys_async` — so the boundary userland crosses in M5 is the one it
will keep crossing when programs become instances.

The cost is an untyped op number in place of a symbol, and it is real: a
mismatch between `FsOp` in `src/fs/hostfs.h` and `OP` in `web/fs.js` is a wrong
answer rather than a link error. That is why `test/fakefs.mjs` imports its
constants and its encoders *from* `web/fs.js` rather than restating them — the
two sides of the wire cannot drift without the tests noticing.

### A request outlives its awaiter

`wake(token, ptr, len)` carries two words, and a directory listing is not two
words. Something has to own a buffer the host can write into, and the obvious
answer — export `kalloc`/`kfree` and let JS allocate — is wrong in a way that
took a moment to see.

The problem is cancellation. `^C` during `ls /home` destroys the frame that
issued the request. If the reply buffer lived in that frame, or was owned by the
host on the frame's behalf, the promise resolving a moment later would write
into freed memory. Every awaitable in this system deregisters in its destructor
precisely so that destroying a suspended frame is safe (§8.1), and a raw address
handed across the boundary defeats that.

So a request is a heap record with its own path and reply buffers, and
`FsCall`'s destructor does not free it. If the reply has landed, the record
goes; if it has not, the record is *orphaned* — moved to a list and left alive
at the address the host holds. The reply is what finally reaps it, which is why
`sched_wake` now returns a bool and `wake()` routes an undelivered token to
`fs_orphan_reply`. An unclaimed token was previously ignored; now it is the one
signal that says a record is safe to free.

Two flags decide a record's fate, and both are easy to get wrong. `issued_` says
the host was given the address at all — a request cancelled before it reached
the import has nothing to wait for and must be freed, not orphaned, or it leaks
silently. `done` says the reply landed, and it cannot simply be set on the
resume path: a cancellation also resumes. `sched_cancel` is the only thing that
sets `Waiter::cancelled`, so `done = issued_ && !w_.cancelled` is exactly right,
including the case where a cancellation arrives *after* the reply and the
request is finished with regardless. `test_hostfs` exists for this and nothing
else.

This also keeps the export surface where §3.4 put it: `init`, `wake`, `tick`,
`key`, `resize` and `memory` is what M5 ships, exactly as M2 did.

### Naming is asynchronous; an open file is not

Concept.md §3.6's `Fs` was `read`/`write`/`list`, all returning `Task`.
Splitting it instead by *when the work can happen* is the single change that
makes the rest of the milestone simple.

`stat`, `list`, `open`, `mkdir` and `remove` may need the host, so they park.
`read`, `write`, `size`, `truncate` and `close` act on an open handle, and §5.2
says those are genuinely synchronous on OPFS. Following that split gives
redirection its shape for free: a job opens its files at setup, before any stage
is spawned, and from then on `Stream::Write` is a plain call. The file-backed
`Stream` and `Source` never park, so their `park` hook is null and the whole
retry-on-`Again` path is dead code for them.

It also means a failed open stops the command before it produces side effects,
which is what a shell does and what M4's placeholder refusal was standing in
for.

`read` fills a caller's buffer rather than returning `Bytes`. That is the same
argument the pipe made in M4: a `Span` is a pointer and a length, and nothing
below the VFS owns a buffer the caller may keep.

### /bin is a filesystem

M4's `ls` listed the program registry and its comment promised that M5 would
replace the body with a walk of the mount table. Doing only that would have left
`/bin` an empty directory — programs are in-kernel coroutines until M8 — and the
registry reachable only through `help`.

`BinFs` is about sixty lines and fixes both: the registry *is* a read-only
filesystem mounted on `/bin`, `ls` really is an ordinary directory walk, and
`ls /bin | grep hel` still means what it meant in M4. A file there reads as the
program's usage line, because that is the only thing about a program there is to
read. When M8 gives programs binaries, the mount changes and nothing above it
does.

It lives in `src/user/` rather than `src/fs/` because the registry does, and
`braam_fs` must not depend upwards.

### The bundle is an archive, not the Cache API

§5.1 pairs `BundleFs` with the Cache API. The Cache API stores
`Request`/`Response` pairs, which is a good fit *once something is producing
them* — and that is `fetch`, which is M6. Using it now would mean pulling M6's
import forward to serve a tree that never changes after the build.

Instead the worker loads one `bundle.bin` beside `kernel.wasm` and hands the
bytes over through the `Bundle` operation, and `BundleFs` unpacks it in memory.
One request instead of one per file, no new import, and the format is small
enough that `tools/pack.py` and `src/fs/bundlefs.cpp` are each about eighty
lines. The smoke test is given the archive the build just produced, so the
packer and the reader are checked against each other rather than each against
its own reading of the format.

*Superseded.* The archive is unpacked into the store rather than mounted from
memory, so the kernel does not read it at all and the hand-rolled format bought
nothing — it is `rootfs.zip` now, and only `web/fs.js` parses it. See "One
store, and rootfs.zip". The last sentence still holds: the smoke test is still
given the archive the build just produced.

### Two round trips, not one enormous buffer

A reply whose size is not known in advance — a listing, the bundle — is asked
for twice: the first attempt reports the room it needs and writes nothing, and
the kernel retries with a buffer that size. The alternative is a buffer big
enough for anything, and the allocator makes that expensive in a specific way:
512 bytes is the top size class and a byte more costs a whole 64 KiB span
(§8.2). A directory that fits in a block — nearly all of them — costs one trip;
one that does not costs two, and only pays for a span when it genuinely needs
one.

That is also why files are read `FS_BLOCK` = 512 bytes at a time, and why
`file_read` stages through a stack buffer rather than a `String`: reading is
synchronous, so the buffer does not have to survive a suspension, and a 512-byte
chunk lands exactly in the top size class on its way into a pipe.

### One open handle per file

§5.2 said the open-file table should refuse a second *writer*. It refuses a
second open of any kind, because that is what OPFS actually enforces:
`createSyncAccessHandle()` takes an exclusive lock and a second handle fails
whatever mode it asks for.

The looser rule would have worked on `MemFs` and failed on OPFS, which is the
worst outcome — a program that behaves differently depending on which mount its
path landed in. `cat a a` is refused as a result. That is a real restriction and
an odd command, and the honest rule is worth more than the odd command.

### The working directory is a global

A program is `Task<i32>(Args, Stdio)`. There is nowhere to put a per-process cwd
until §4.3's ABI gives a process a context, which is M8. With one shell running,
a global and a per-process cwd are indistinguishable, so `cd` mutates one
`String` in the VFS and the difference is deferred rather than designed around.

The shell starts in `/home` rather than `/`, which is what makes
`echo hi > notes` land somewhere that survives a reload without the user having
to know that it must. The prompt stays `$`: putting the cwd in it is layout
work, and it belongs with M7 rather than with a change that would churn every
screen assertion in the tests.

### Boot happens in the shell, before the first prompt

Mounting needs to `co_await`, and `init()` is not a coroutine. Spawning a
mounter alongside the shell would race the first prompt against the mount table.
Awaiting it in `shell()` before the prompt is the only ordering that is correct,
and it is also where the "no OPFS" line belongs — the third acceptance criterion
is a sentence printed above the first prompt.

*Superseded in part.* The ordering is unchanged and the reason for it stands,
but the line above the first prompt is now a refusal rather than a warning, and
there is no prompt after it. See "One store, and rootfs.zip".

The work is in `boot_filesystem()` rather than inline so that its locals stay
out of the shell's frame, which has a size class to fit inside; `test_shell`
guards that at 1 KiB and the guard is why the split exists. It is idempotent,
because a test boots the shell a dozen times against one mount table and every
one of those must not report the mounts as errors.

### Proving the reload without a browser

"Write a file, reload the page, the file is still there" reads like a criterion
only a browser can check. It is not: what a reload destroys is the
`WebAssembly.Instance`, and what it preserves is the store behind OPFS.
`test/fakefs.mjs` puts the store in module scope, so the smoke test writes a
file, throws the instance away, instantiates the same module again, and reads it
back — with a real browser check still required before the milestone is
believed, but with the mechanism itself under CI.

The fake answers from inside the import, which no browser can do. The kernel
cannot tell: `wake()` only queues a resumption, and the tick that issued the
request drains the queue on its way out. One case in the smoke test holds
replies back anyway and delivers them by hand, so the genuinely-parked path is
covered too rather than assumed.

### Smaller decisions

- **`Error::NotEmpty` is new.** `rm` on a populated directory needed a message
  of its own, and overloading `Invalid` would have printed "invalid" for the one
  error a user hits by accident.
- **`heap_new`/`heap_delete` are new.** `operator new` returns null on failure
  and `-fno-exceptions` means a plain `new` would then construct at address
  zero. Every allocation in `src/fs/` goes through the checked pair instead;
  `job.cpp`'s hand-rolled version is now one of them.
- **`vfs_list` folds in mount points.** A mount point need not exist in the
  filesystem beneath it, so `ls /` would not have shown `/home` at all. The
  table supplies the entry.
- **Listings are sorted in the VFS, not in `ls`.** Insertion sort over a
  directory, which needs no scratch and is small enough not to matter — and it
  means every consumer sees a stable order, not just the one that remembered to
  sort.
- **`persisted` is posted down from the page.** `navigator.storage.persist()` is
  not available in a worker (§A.2), and boot waits for the answer rather than
  guessing: `df` reporting the wrong durability is worse than a tick of delay.
- **`close` flushes.** A sync access handle buffers, and flushing on every write
  would give up the reason for using one. Closing is the point at which we know
  it is safe.

## M4 — Streams

Pipes with real backpressure, stdin, the whole shell grammar, and a `^C` that
reaches a running pipeline. This is the milestone where three debts recorded
below come due at once — `send()`'s policy, the owning token store quoting
forces, and a shell that can watch the keyboard while a child runs — and where
the first thing in the system runs genuinely concurrently with another. 62,926
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against an unchanged 256 KiB budget.

Nothing here changed a design *decision*, so `Concept.md` is not amended. Two
comments that described plans rather than facts are: `tty.h`'s, which proposed
putting the screen behind a byte channel, and `shell.cpp`'s, which named an
argv-lifetime invariant that no longer exists.

### A pipe carries owning chunks, not `Bytes`

M4's objective says `Channel<Bytes>` and `Bytes` already exists —
`using Bytes = Span<const u8>` — so the obvious reading is that a pipe moves
`Bytes`. It cannot. A `Span` is a pointer and a length, and the whole point of a
pipe is that the reader runs *later*: by the time it takes the value, the
writer's buffer is a dead coroutine frame. The channel has to own what it
carries, so a pipe is `Channel<String, 8>` and `Stream::Write` copies into a
`String` on the way in.

The copy is the price of the decoupling and it is the same copy `Bytes` would
have needed somewhere else, in a place with less obvious ownership. `String`
also happens to satisfy exactly what the ring needs — a default constructor for
the inline slots and move-assignment for `try_send` — which is not a
coincidence: `Vec<String>` was already proven by the editor's history.

Capacity is counted in *chunks*, not bytes, so one huge write occupies one slot
and backpressure is per-write. Eight slots is enough to keep a producer and a
consumer both busy without making the block that holds them large; the number is
one constant in `io.h`.

### What `send()` decided

M2 deferred blocking send because the decisions belonged to pipes. Here they
are.

**A cancelled sender delivers nothing.** The value lives in the awaitable and
dies with it; the ring is only ever written by `put()`, which a cancelled sender
never reaches. That is the only answer that keeps cancellation meaning "unwinds
by returning", because a half-delivered value would have to be either dropped
silently or delivered by a task that has already been killed.

**A full channel parks.** Not an error, not a drop — parking *is* backpressure,
and a pipe that dropped would make `ls | wc` report a number that depends on
scheduling. The one place that deliberately drops instead is the tty pump, for
the reason M2 gives about the keyboard ring.

**Closing is directional, because a pipe is.** `close()` is the writer saying
there is no more: the receiver drains what is queued and only *then* reads
`Err(Closed)`, so nothing in flight is lost. `hangup()` is the reader saying it
will take no more: parked and future senders get `Err(Closed)`. Two verbs rather
than one, because "the far end is gone" means opposite things at the two ends,
and a single `close()` would have had to guess which.

`Error::Closed` is a new value rather than a reuse of `Again`. `Again` is
already the stray-wake sentinel — "you were woken but there is nothing here" —
and end of input is the opposite claim. Overloading it would have made a
spurious `wake()` from JS indistinguishable from EOF.

### `take()` wakes the sender, not `await_resume`

The obvious symmetry to `try_send` waking a parked receiver is
`Recv::await_resume` waking a parked sender, and it deadlocks.
`Recv::await_ready` is `!empty()`, so a receiver that finds the ring non-empty
never suspends and is never resumed by a wake — and that is the *ordinary* case
for a pipe, where the reader is usually behind. The wake has to live in
`take()`, which is the one thing every path that removes a value goes through.

The same reasoning put the closed check into `await_ready`: a receiver parked on
an empty pipe has nothing coming to wake it when the writer closes, so `close()`
has to wake it explicitly and `await_ready` has to admit that a closed empty
channel is ready.

### The intrusive waiter queue is still not needed, and now says so

M2's notes hand this milestone the job of putting intrusive queue links inside
`Waiter`, so that deregistration lives in one place, "when `send()` needs it
too". It does not need it. Every channel in the system has exactly one writer —
each pipe has one upstream stage, `err` is the console, the input pipe has only
the pump, and the report channel uses `try_send` — so a single `send_token_`,
symmetric with the existing `recv_token_`, holds every case, and the existing
cancellation path works untouched.

That is true of *this* grammar. `2>&1` would join two writers onto one channel
and silently clobber a token, which is the kind of bug that shows up as a lost
wakeup three milestones later. So `Send::await_suspend` and `park_sender` panic
if a second sender arrives, and the operator that would trip it arrives with the
queue work rather than before it.

### The pipeline is a heap block, and could not be anything else

The natural shape is locals in the shell's frame: the parsed pipeline, the
pipes, the report channel. Two things forbid it, and both are load-bearing
enough that `test_shell` guards them.

The allocator's top size class is 512 bytes and anything above it takes a whole
64 KiB span, so a shell frame carrying a pipeline would cost a span *per shell*.
And `~Sched` destroys jobs in spawn order — the shell first — so a stage frame
pointing into the shell's frame is a use-after-free during `sched_reset`, which
the test suite does after every case.

One object answers both: a refcounted heap block holding the frozen pipeline,
the pipes, the report channel and the pid list. The shell holds a reference,
each stage holds one through an RAII local in its own frame, and the last one
out frees it — so the order they leave in stops mattering. `~Sched` also now
runs backwards, since a child is spawned after its parent, and `sched_cancel`
stands down while it does, because `jobs` holds freed pointers as that loop
walks.

The pipes inside it are individually heap-allocated rather than an array, for a
smaller reason with the same shape: `Channel` deletes its copy constructor,
which suppresses the implicit move, so `Vec<Channel>` does not compile — and an
inline array of eight would have pushed the block past 512 anyway.

### A tty pump, not a `select`

M3's notes name the two candidates for interrupting a running program: a second
receiver on a single-receiver channel, or a `select`-shaped combinator. Neither
is what landed, because both fight the same constraint from opposite sides —
`CancelState::waiting` is a single slot, so one task tree can be parked on
exactly one awaiter, and a select over two channels needs two.

Instead the keyboard changes hands. While a pipeline runs, a spawned pump
coroutine is the only receiver on `keys()` and the shell is parked on the job's
report channel; when the job ends the pump is cancelled and the shell takes the
keyboard back. The one-receiver rule holds at every instant, and it holds
*structurally* rather than by luck: `sched_unwait` knows nothing about channels,
so a cancelled pump leaves its token in `keys()` until its `~Recv` runs, and the
shell must not re-register before then. That is why the pump files a report of
its own and the shell waits for it — the report is proof the pump has unwound.
The equality guard in `~Recv` is now load-bearing for two receivers rather than
one, and is commented as such.

The pump never parks on the input pipe, and that is not an optimisation.
`ls | grep foo` reads no stdin, so a blocking pump would fill the eight-slot
ring after eight keystrokes, park, stop being the receiver on `keys()` — and
make `^C` unreachable, defeating the milestone's own criterion within a second
of key autorepeat. It drops instead, which is the policy `key()` already uses on
the keyboard ring and for the same reason: there is nowhere to report a full
ring to.

This also means the shell has exactly one path. A single command is a one-stage
pipeline with a pump, costing two extra job records and two frames, because the
`^C` criterion is met by `sleep 5000` and a fast path for single commands would
have left precisely that case broken.

### Structured concurrency, put back by hand

§3.6 says a parent `co_await`s a child group and cancellation propagates down
the tree. The stages here are independent scheduler jobs with independent
`CancelState`s, so it does not. That is forced rather than chosen: the stages of
a pipeline must all be parked at once, one job cannot have two children parked
at once, and `sched_spawn` is the only concurrency there is.

What §3.6 buys is put back explicitly. A destructor in `run_line`'s frame
cancels every launched stage and the pump — a destructor rather than a branch,
because a cancelled coroutine cannot park again to clean up (every
`await_suspend` here declines to suspend once the flag is set) and because the
frame may be destroyed outright rather than resumed. The same reasoning shapes a
stage's epilogue: closing its output, hanging up its input and filing its report
all happen in a destructor, so they also happen when the stage is cancelled or
destroyed while suspended.

That epilogue is the whole of the early-close mechanism. `head -n 1` needs no
way to say "I am done" — it returns, its runner hangs up its input, and the next
write upstream gets `Err(Closed)`.

A real child-group awaitable is what would retire this, and it needs the
intrusive `Waiter` links above. The two deferrals are the same deferral.

### A frame that will not allocate is now a value

`operator new` returns null and its comment says callers must check, but no
promise declared `get_return_object_on_allocation_failure`, so the compiler was
entitled to assume it never does. `sched_spawn`'s `if (!t) return 0` was written
in anticipation of this and could not fire.

M4 is where it matters, because "how many stages actually launched" is a number
the shell has to wait for exactly. So `TaskPromise` declares the handler, which
also switches frame allocation to the nothrow `operator new` the standard names
for it — hence a `std::nothrow_t` in `types.h`, which is a declaration the
freestanding build has to supply like everything else. Awaiting a task whose
frame never allocated panics rather than reading a promise that does not exist;
only a spawned root turns the failure into a value, which is the only place that
can do anything with it.

### The terminal stays a cell grid

`tty.h` said M4 would replace the console sink with a pair of `Channel<Bytes>`
and move the screen behind a reader task. It does not, and the comment is
amended instead. §2.3 is the stronger argument: the terminal *is* a cell grid,
and a byte channel in front of it would add a copy, a frame and a scheduling hop
to reach an array `screen_write` already fills synchronously — while putting
terminal output behind a bounded queue that can drop. The one thing the reader
task would have bought, `prog | prog` and `prog | screen` sharing one mechanism,
the `Stream` function pointer gives for nothing.

`Stream` did have to grow. A sink can now answer `Err(Again)` for "full, park
me" and gets a second function pointer to arm the wake token with; `Write`
gained a `Waiter` and, more importantly, a destructor that deregisters it,
without which a frame destroyed mid-write leaves a dangling pointer in the wake
table — exactly the bug the channel notes below describe. `Write` retries once
after being woken, which is enough because a pipe has one writer and being woken
by `take()` means there is room; a second `Again` is a stray wake, and
`write_all` loops for the programs that care. `Stream::write` stayed an
awaitable rather than becoming a `Task` for the reason M3 gives: a coroutine
frame per write is the hot path §8.2 warns about.

`Source` is its mirror, and `Stdio` gained an `in`. A program the shell gave no
input gets a source that reports EOF immediately rather than a null one, so no
program has to check.

### The store that replaced the borrow

M3's notes predicted this exactly: quote removal produces words that are not
substrings of the line, which destroys the zero-copy argv path and forces an
owning token store the parser is built around. Both halves happened.

Words are appended to one growing `String` and turned into `Str` only by
`freeze()`, because the store reallocates while it grows and every view into it
would move. Making that a rule enforced by the API rather than by a comment
matters more than it looks: `add_word` panics after `freeze`, and the accessors
panic before it, so the one ordering that must hold cannot be got wrong quietly.
Moving a *frozen* pipeline is still safe — `String` and `Vec` move by stealing
the pointer, so nothing shifts — and that is what lets the parse result live in
the job block rather than in a frame. It would not be true of a
small-string-optimised string, which is worth knowing before anyone adds one.

`Args` stays a non-owning `Span<const Str>`, now over the store rather than over
the shell's line buffer. The invariant M3's comment called "the single easiest
thing for M4's pipelines to break" is not preserved so much as retired: nothing
borrows from `line.text` any more.

Redirection targets live in a second table rather than among the words, so that
a command's argv stays contiguous. `> f ls` would otherwise put `f` in `ls`'s
argv.

### Redirection is parsed and refused

Quoting, escaping, `|` and `>` are one grammar and writing half of it means
writing it twice, so all of it is written. There is no filesystem to redirect
*to* until M5, so a path target is refused — but at pipeline setup, before
anything is spawned, rather than at the first write. A sink that fails on its
first write would let a command run and produce its side effects before its
redirection turned out to be impossible, which is not what a shell does. When M5
lands, one function turns the refusal into an open.

`out` and `err` are still the same sink, for the reason M3 gave: `2>` is parsed,
so the split is now expressible, but there is nowhere for it to go.

### `ls` lists the registry

The criterion is `ls | grep foo`, and `ls` lists a filesystem that arrives a
milestone later. Rather than reword the criterion or pull `MemFs` forward, `ls`
lists the program registry — which is what `/bin` will hold, and which §4's tier
table already calls a kernel applet's job. The criterion is met literally, the
pipeline it exists to prove is proved, and M5 replaces a loop over
`program_first()` with a walk of the mount table while the test stays green.

### Smaller decisions

`clear` still writes to the grid rather than to `io.out`. Clearing is a grid
operation with no byte representation, so `clear > f` is meaningless; the honest
cost is that `clear | cat` clears the screen, which is what it says it does.

`grep` is a substring match, and its usage line says "text" rather than implying
a pattern language. `cat` copies chunks rather than lines, so it is byte-exact
and a final line without a newline stays that way; `grep`, `head`, `tail` and
the rest go through a `LineReader` that keeps a partial chunk, so a line may
span any number of chunks. `wc` counts over raw chunks for the same reason —
nothing should depend on where a chunk happens to break.

`LineEnd::Eof` is still not there. ^D closes a program's stdin through the pump,
which is where end of input actually means something; at the prompt there is
nowhere to exit to, and inventing a meaning for it before there is one is how
enums acquire dead members.

The size more than doubled, 28,282 to 62,926 bytes, which is 24% of the budget
M3 raised with exactly this in mind. Six new programs, a lexer, a parser, the
job runtime and a second awaitable pair account for it; the budget is not moved.

---

## M3 — Userland shell

The `LineEditor` coroutine §3.5 promised, a tokeniser, the self-registering
program registry of §3.6, argv and exit codes — and the first build where the
thing on screen is an operating environment rather than a demonstration. 28,282
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against a budget raised from 32 KiB to 256 KiB in this
milestone.

### Static initialisers now run, and one invariant is retired

M0 left a question open — "self-registration needs `__wasm_call_ctors`, which
`--no-entry` leaves uncalled, and that question is better settled in M3 where
the program registry actually depends on it" — and this is where it is settled.
`init()` calls `__wasm_call_ctors()` itself.

The alternative was a linker-section table: a `constexpr` descriptor per program
placed in a custom data section with `__attribute__((section, used, retain))`,
walked between the linker-defined `__start_`/`__stop_` symbols. It needs no
constructors at all, so it would have kept the invariant intact. It was not
chosen because §3.6 says "populated at static-init time by an inline registrar"
and there was no reason to route around the spec; because the section trick is a
second, undocumented dependency on linker behaviour on top of the ones Appendix
C already records; and because static init is a capability the whole system
wants once, not a trick one subsystem uses.

`__wasm_call_ctors` is synthesised by wasm-ld with hidden visibility, so a plain
`extern "C"` declaration reaches it and **no export is added** — the
exact-surface assertion in `run.mjs` is the guard on that claim, and it would
have fired on the first build if the assumption were wrong. The call sits
*after* `heap_init`, so a constructor added later may allocate; that ordering is
the new invariant and it is commented at the call site.

What does not change is the destructor half. `__cxa_atexit` is still unprovided,
deliberately, so a namespace-scope global with a non-trivial destructor is still
a link error. `Heap`, `Screen`, `Channel` and the registry's list head remain
PODs; `Sched` remains behind a pointer. CLAUDE.md's statement of the rule has
been amended, because its first clause — that `--no-entry` never calls
`__wasm_call_ctors` — is now false of this kernel.

`tests.wasm` calls it too, so the cases see the registry the shipping kernel
sees. Its own case list stays explicit in `main.cpp`: the order is load-bearing
where cases share global state, and converting it would be an unrelated refactor
riding along in this milestone.

### A sorted intrusive list, not a `HashMap`

M1's notes anticipated the registry wanting `HashMap`'s FNV-1a overload for
`Str` keys. It does not. `help` has to *enumerate* the registry and `HashMap`
has no iteration API; `HashMap::insert` allocates, and a static-init registrar
must not touch the heap before anyone has reasoned about whether it exists; and
with seven programs a linear scan of `Str` compares is not measurable against
the coroutine frame the lookup is about to allocate anyway.

Insertion is sorted rather than push-front, which costs nothing at seven entries
and buys something specific: the order of static initialisation across
translation units is unspecified, so a push-front list would make `help`'s
output depend on the link order, and therefore make it untestable. Sorted,
`help` needs no sort of its own and the smoke test can assert the listing.

### `src/prog/` is an OBJECT library, and that is not a detail

Nothing in the system references `src/prog/echo.cpp` by name. Those translation
units reach the link only through their registrars, and `--gc-sections` never
extracts an archive member that no symbol references — the same trap
`CMakeLists.txt` already documents for `main.cpp`. As a `STATIC` library,
`src/prog/` would link cleanly and produce a kernel with an empty registry: no
warning, no error, a shell where every command is "not found". CMake puts an
OBJECT library's objects directly on the consuming link line, which is exactly
the property required.

Because that failure is silent, `test_prog` asserts the exact *count* of
registered programs and their order, not that a few known names are present. A
spot check would survive losing the programs it does not name.

### The exit code goes in the prompt

"A nonzero exit code is observable" has two obvious readings: a diagnostic line
after every failure, or a status indicator in the prompt. The prompt wins on
four counts. It is one screen read for the smoke test — `false` followed by a
row reading `[1] $` proves the criterion in a single assertion, and `nosuch`
followed by `[127] $` proves the not-found path in the same shape. It invents no
stream semantics before M4 defines them: a diagnostic line for every nonzero
status would be the shell writing to a stderr that does not yet mean anything,
and no real shell does it. It costs nothing in the common case. And it composes
forward, since a pipeline's status is its last command's and nothing about the
prompt changes.

The shell reads that status by `co_await`ing the program's `Task<i32>` rather
than spawning it. That is not a style choice: `sched_tick` reaps a finished job
and destroys it, so the promise's `i32` is unreachable after the fact, and
awaiting is the only way to see it at all. Awaiting is also what propagates the
`CancelState` into the program, and what makes the single-receiver rule on the
keyboard hold — while a program runs the shell is suspended inside `co_await`,
not on `keys()`, so nothing can displace anything. Keys typed during a program
stay in the ring as typeahead.

### `Vec<char32_t>` for the line, and a redraw that infers its own scrolling

The line buffer is one codepoint per element, not UTF-8. In M3 one codepoint is
one cell, so every editing operation and all of the redraw's column arithmetic
is plain indexing; with a `String`, Left, Right, Backspace, kill-word and the
wrap calculation would each need a codepoint scan, and mid-line insertion would
need a byte shuffle regardless. The cost is four bytes per character against a
span allocator, which is noise, and the single UTF-8 encode happens once, at
Return. The payoff is that `String::insert`/`erase` never had to be written;
`Vec::insert`/`erase` did, and they are useful to everything else.

The screen has no erase-to-end-of-line, no insert-character and no scroll
counter, so the editor repaints the whole line from an anchor on every keystroke
and blanks the tail by hand, tracking how many cells the previous paint covered.
The interesting part is keeping the anchor correct when a paint scrolls the
grid: nothing reports a scroll, so the editor computes where the write *should*
have ended — `y0 + (x0 + n - 1) / cols`, using the deferred wrap — and takes the
shortfall against the actual `cursor_y` as the number of rows the grid moved.
That is exact, because `screen_newline` is the only thing besides our own writes
that can move the cursor.

Two consequences worth stating. `screen_move` clamps to `cols - 1`, so the
deferred-wrap column is unreachable by cursor addressing; the editor places a
cursor at an exact multiple of `cols` at column 0 of the *next* row, which is
not a compromise — after `wrap_pending` that is genuinely where the next
character lands. And a line longer than the whole grid pushes its own prompt off
the top, after which the anchor clamps at row 0 and the leftmost cells are
wrong. Fixing that needs a line model the grid does not have, which is the M7
layout layer's; M3 accepts the cosmetic glitch and tests the case that matters,
where the anchor follows a scroll correctly.

An unconditional repaint is more work than the common case needs — appending at
the end with no wrap is one `screen_put`. It is a few hundred cell writes
coalesced into one damage rectangle and one `host_present` per tick, which is
nothing at keyboard rates, and the optimisation can be added later against a
test suite that already pins the behaviour down.

### `Stream::Write` does its work in `await_suspend`

§3.6 fixes the program signature as `Task<int>(Args, Stdio)`, and M4 will put a
`Channel<Bytes>` behind `Stdio` where a write to a full pipe has to park.
Writing `io.out.write(s)` as a plain call now would mean rewriting every call
site in `src/prog/` then; writing it as `co_await io.out.write(s)` from the
start costs a suspend point that is never taken.

The work happens in `await_suspend`, which returns `false` to resume
immediately, rather than in an `await_ready` that returns `true`. Only
`await_suspend` receives the coroutine handle, and therefore the promise, and
therefore the `CancelState` — an awaitable that completes in `await_ready` would
be the one thing in the system that cannot see cancellation, which §8.1 exists
to forbid. A never-taken suspend point in exchange for the rule holding
everywhere is a good trade.

`Stream` is a function pointer plus a `void *`, not a virtual interface. There
will be exactly two implementations, and a vtable costs a data section and an
indirect-call table entry per implementation for no gain. `out` and `err` are
the same sink in M3, because the split is meaningless until there is redirection
to tell them apart.

### The tokeniser has no quoting, on purpose

Quote *removal* produces tokens that are not substrings of the input, which
destroys the zero-copy property the whole argv path depends on — `Args` is a
`Span<const Str>` over views into the shell's line buffer, and nothing copies.
Supporting quotes would force an owning token store that M4's parser would then
have to be built around. And quoting, escaping, `|` and `>` are one grammar:
writing half of it now means writing it twice. The visible consequence is that
`echo 'a b'` prints the quotes, which is stated in `echo`'s usage line rather
than hidden.

The lifetime that makes this work — `argv` borrowing from `line.text`, which is
a named local in the shell's frame and stays alive across the `co_await` of the
program — is commented in `shell.cpp`, because it is the single easiest thing
for M4's pipelines to break.

### What ^C does, and what it does not do yet

Typed at the prompt, ^C writes `^C`, abandons the buffer and returns
`LineEnd::Interrupt`; the shell prints a fresh prompt carrying 130. Typed while
a program runs, it sits in the keyboard ring and is consumed as typeahead by the
next `read_line`.

Interrupting a *running* program is M4's criterion and stays there. It needs the
shell to watch the keyboard while a child runs — a second receiver on a
single-receiver channel, or a `select`-shaped combinator — and both are streams
work. What M3 owes is that the mechanism underneath is already in place, which
is what the cancellation cases in `test_edit` and `test_shell` assert:
`sched_cancel` on the shell unwinds through `co_await`ing a program, through a
running `sleep`, and out of a `Recv` parked on the keyboard, with the channel
left usable.

`LineEnd` is a named enum rather than a bool for the same reason: M4 and M7 will
add `Eof` and whatever a job-control shell needs, and the signature should not
change when they do.

### Smaller decisions

`sleep` takes **milliseconds**. There is no float parser, the scheduler is a
millisecond machine, and the smoke test needs an exact number to assert
`tick()`'s return value against. The divergence from POSIX lives in the usage
string.

`read_line` is `Task<Result<Line>>` on the `LineEditor`, where §3.3 sketches
`Task<Line> read_line(Tty&)`. §3.3's sketch already diverges from shipped
signatures — it lists `Task<void> sleep_ms(u32)` where the kernel has
`Task<Result<void>>` — so it is read as illustrative, and `Concept.md` is not
amended. Nothing in M3 changed a design *decision*, which is the bar for
touching the spec.

`utf8_decode` moved out of `screen.cpp` into `src/kernel/text.h`, because the
editor needs to decode history entries and two decoders in one system is one too
many. The behaviour changed in one untested corner: a stray continuation byte
now yields U+FFFD and draws, where it used to be skipped silently. Visible
corruption beats invisible corruption.

Ctrl-W is bound to kill-word and unit-tested, but `web/keys.js` deliberately
leaves Ctrl+W to the browser, which closes the tab — a page that swallows it is
a page you cannot leave. So Alt-Backspace is bound to the same action and is the
one that actually reaches a browser. That is a keybinding decision, not a change
to what `keys.js` forwards.

### The budget moved

M0 set 32 KiB and M1 and M2 stayed well inside it. M3 does not: the shell, the
editor and seven programs took `kernel.wasm` from 14,011 to 28,282 bytes, about
86% of the old ceiling, with M4's streams and M5's filesystem still to come. The
budget is now 256 KiB. That is a deliberate act, as the file's own comment
requires, and the reasoning is that 32 KiB was a nucleus-sized number chosen
when the nucleus was all there was; a self-contained operating environment with
a filesystem and a program set is not a 32 KiB artifact, and a ceiling that has
to be raised every milestone measures nothing. 256 KiB is still small enough
that a regression of the kind the check exists to catch — a libc dependency, an
accidental template explosion — moves it visibly.

Roughly 4.4 KiB of the 28 KiB is the wasm `name` section. It is kept:
`--strip-all` would remove it, and with it every symbol name in a browser stack
trace.

---

## M2 — Screen and keys

The cell grid, its damage rectangle and the canvas renderer, `Channel<T>`, and
the `key` and `resize` exports that complete §3.4's five — §2.3 and §3.5 made
real, plus the first code in the system that a user can see. 14,011 bytes of
`kernel.wasm`, against the same 32 KiB budget.

### `resize` returns where the screen is

§3.4 lists `resize(cols, rows)` with no return value, but the renderer has to
learn three things from somewhere: the address of the cell array, the geometry,
and where the cursor is. Four mechanisms could carry them. A hard-coded address
reverses M0's deliberate decision that the host stays ignorant of the kernel's
memory map. Exporting a wasm global needs a linker flag, and exports are named
with `BRAAM_EXPORT` or not at all. Widening `host_present` re-sends unchanging
geometry on every frame and only tells the host anything *after* the first
paint. A separate `screen()` export is the honest alternative and was close, but
`resize` is already the one call that reallocates the grid, so it is already the
moment every cached view has to be re-derived (§8.4) — making it also the moment
the address is handed over keeps that discipline in one place instead of two,
and keeps the export list at the five §3.4 names.

So `resize` returns the address of a static `Screen` descriptor, or 0 if the new
grid could not be allocated. Static, not heap, so the address is a link-time
constant the host can hold forever; and it carries a `'BSCR'` magic word, so a
renderer paired with the wrong build says so rather than drawing noise. §3.4 is
amended.

Failure is all-or-nothing: the replacement grid is allocated and filled before
anything is published, so a `resize` that returns 0 leaves the old screen whole
and still on display. And the geometry is clamped — 512 columns by 256 rows —
because `cols * rows * sizeof(Cell)` is computed in a 32-bit `usize`, and a host
that asked for 30000×20000 would otherwise wrap it to a small allocation and
then write past the end. The host reads `cols` and `rows` back out of the
descriptor instead of assuming it got what it asked for, which makes clamping,
out-of-memory and success one path on the JS side: *draw what the descriptor
says*.

### One rectangle, flushed once a tick, with the cursor folded in

Damage could be presented per write, which would mean an import call per
character. It is instead accumulated into a single rectangle and flushed from
`tick()` after `sched_tick()` returns, so a tick that typed a line presents once
and an idle tick presents not at all. `tick()` in `main.cpp` does the flushing
rather than the scheduler, so the screen does not become a dependency of the
scheduler.

The cursor is drawn by the renderer and stored nowhere, which means moving it
dirties two cells: the one it left and the one it entered. Marking both at every
site that moves the cursor works until someone adds a site and forgets — and
M3's line editor will add several. So `screen_flush` remembers where the cursor
was last drawn and folds the move into the rectangle itself. Mutations now only
have to mark cells they actually wrote, and the ghost-cursor bug is unavailable
by construction.

### Channel wakeups reuse the token table

A receiver suspended on an empty channel has to be resumed by whichever
`try_send` fills it. The obvious mechanism is a new scheduler entry point taking
the `Waiter *` the channel holds — and it is a trap. `sched_cancel` unwaits and
readies a waiter, but `sched_unwait` knows only about the timer queue and the
wake table; it cannot unlink from a channel it has never heard of. A cancelled
receiver would therefore sit on the ready queue while still listed in the
channel, and the next `try_send` would queue the same handle a second time.
Fixing that properly means intrusive queue links inside `Waiter` so that
deregistration stays in one place, which is real machinery and, on the evidence,
M4's to build when `send()` needs it too.

The channel instead allocates a wake token and stores only the token, not the
pointer. `sched_wake` on a token nothing waits on is already defined to be
ignored — "a late or cancelled event" — so a stale token after a cancellation is
ordinary traffic rather than a use-after-free, and every existing path works
untouched: `sched_unwait` in the awaiter's destructor deregisters,
`sched_cancel` already knows how to pull a token waiter out. Nothing in
`sched.h` or `sched.cpp` changed for M2.

The cost is a hash insert and remove per suspension, which is nothing at
keyboard rates and worth revisiting in M4 when `Channel<Bytes>` carries pipe
traffic. The price of a globally visible token is that a stray `wake()` from JS
can resume a receiver spuriously, so `await_resume` checks the ring rather than
trusting the wake and returns `Error::Again` when there is nothing to take.
Without that check the count would underflow.

### `Channel<T>` gets its mechanism, M4 gets its policy

§3.6 specifies both `co_await ch.recv()` and `co_await ch.send(v)`. Only `recv`
and a non-blocking `try_send` landed. The size argument for deferring would be
bogus — an uninstantiated member of a class template emits nothing — but
blocking send needs decisions M2 has no way to make: what a cancelled sender
does with its half-delivered value, whether a full channel with no receiver
parks or errors, and what closing one does to the senders waiting on it. Those
are pipe semantics, and M4 defines them. An awaiter nothing awaits is an awaiter
nothing tests, and the test suite is the thing that has found every real bug so
far.

The ring is inline rather than heap-allocated, which is what lets the keyboard
channel be a plain global. A `--no-entry` binary never runs `__wasm_call_ctors`,
so a global has to be correct when zero-initialised and trivially destructible —
the same constraint that pushed the scheduler behind a pointer in M1, solved the
other way here because a fixed-capacity ring has no allocation to do. Sending
therefore cannot fail for want of memory, which matters because `key()` is
called from the host with nowhere to report an error to. A full ring drops the
newest event, which is the right failure for a keyboard.

### Keys are codepoints; there are no control characters

`key(code, mods)` carries a Unicode codepoint for anything printable and a value
above `0x110000` for the named keys, so the two can never collide. Enter, Tab
and Backspace are named keys, not `0x0D`, `0x09` and `0x08` — the temptation to
encode them as control characters is exactly what §2.3 exists to refuse. `^C`
arrives as `'c'` with the control modifier set and means whatever its reader
decides; there is no byte anywhere in the system that has to be recognised as an
interrupt, and nothing to mis-parse.

`key()` only queues. Like `wake()`, it never resumes a coroutine, so an event
arriving from the host cannot re-enter the scheduler — and because the worker is
single-threaded and `tick()` is a synchronous call, it cannot arrive mid-tick
anyway. The rule is kept for the same reason `wake()` keeps it: it makes the
question moot for every event source added later. The corresponding obligation
on the host is that `key()` and `resize()` are each followed by `pump()`, since
an idle kernel has no timer armed and queued work would otherwise wait forever.

### Reflow keeps the rows in use, not the bottom of the grid

"Window resize reflows" has three plausible readings. Full re-wrapping of
logical lines is the one a modern terminal does, and it needs a per-row
continuation bit and a notion of line length that the grid does not have; that
is properly M7's, where the layout layer decides who owns line structure.
Keeping the top-left corner is not a reflow but a crop, and it discards
precisely the recent output the user is looking at.

Keeping the bottom-most rows is the obvious remaining answer, and it is wrong in
the common case: a 24-row screen holding one line of output has its text at the
top, so keeping the bottom five rows of it keeps five blank rows and throws the
text away. The smoke test caught exactly that on the boot banner. What survives
is the rows *in use* — `0..cursor_y` — dropping from the top when they no longer
fit and landing at the top of the new grid, since output grows downwards and
that is where the eye already is. A full screen still keeps its bottom, because
there the rows in use are the whole grid.

The wrap is deferred for the same reason: the cursor parks at `cursor_x == cols`
after the last column is filled and only descends when the next character
arrives. Wrapping eagerly would scroll the screen the moment a line reached the
right edge, before there was anything to put on the next one.

### The renderer, and where the font lives

Rendering is the ~300 lines of JavaScript §2.3 promises, in `web/render.js`, and
it does exactly one thing: read cells, draw glyphs. It never calls back into the
kernel — `host_present` runs synchronously inside `tick()`, so a call the other
way would re-enter the scheduler mid-drain. That rule is written next to the
import.

The split between page and worker follows what each one can know. The page owns
the pixel box and reports it in device pixels via `ResizeObserver`'s
`devicePixelContentBoxSize`, which is already correct under fractional zoom; it
also has to watch `devicePixelRatio` with a `matchMedia` query re-armed at each
new ratio, because moving a window to another monitor changes it and nothing
else reports that. The worker owns the font, so it owns the metrics and
therefore the geometry: it measures a glyph, divides, and calls `resize`.
`devicePixelRatio` does not exist in a worker at all, which settles the question
of who computes what. Advance widths are fractional, so the cell width is
rounded once and every glyph is placed at `col * cellW` rather than letting the
font advance across a row; a startup check compares `M` against `i` and warns if
the font turned out not to be monospaced, because that failure otherwise looks
like a kernel bug.

There is no blinking cursor. A blink needs a timer, `tick()` would then never
return `-1`, and the page would never go idle — a visual flourish is not worth a
kernel that never sleeps. `transferControlToOffscreen` has no fallback: without
`SharedArrayBuffer` the main thread cannot see the kernel's memory, so
main-thread rendering is not available at any price, and its absence is reported
rather than worked around.

### What the smoke test now proves

`init` creates an 80×24 grid before anything else, so the kernel is never in a
screenless state and the boot banner has somewhere to go. The host's first
`resize` then reflows that banner into the measured geometry, which makes the
reflow path visible on every page load rather than only when someone drags a
window.

Both M2 criteria are checked against the shipping `kernel.wasm`, not only
against `tests.wasm`: the smoke test resizes, types through `key()`, and asserts
the codepoints landed in the right cells, that the cursor advanced, and that
exactly one `host_present` arrived covering the two written cells *and* the cell
the cursor left. Then it shrinks the screen and asserts the text survived with
the cursor still inside the grid, and that an absurd geometry comes back
clamped. The M1 assertions are unchanged and still pass: the console task
suspends on a channel rather than a timer, so it cannot perturb the tick delays
the M1 test pins down.

---

## M1 — Scheduler

`Task<T>`, a ready queue, a timer queue, wake tokens, `tick()`, `wake()`,
`sleep_ms` and cancellation — the kernel core §3.3 describes, plus the `HashMap`
and `String` that M0 deferred. 8,625 bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against the same 32
KiB budget.

### Timers belong to the kernel, not the host

§3.4 listed both a `host_timer(token, ms)` import and a `tick(now_ms)` that
"returns ms-until-next-timer, or -1". Those overlap: the second only means
anything if the kernel knows when its next deadline is, and if it knows that,
the first is redundant. Only one of them can be the design.

The kernel keeps the timer queue. `sleep_ms` inserts a deadline, `tick` fires
whatever has come due and reports the delay to the next one, and the host's
entire timing responsibility is `setTimeout(pump, delay)`. This wins on three
counts. There is one host timer outstanding instead of one per sleeping task.
The import surface stays at two, so the smoke test's assertion that nothing new
appeared is still a meaningful statement about libc. And, most usefully, the
clock is a *parameter*: tests call `tick(0)`, `tick(10)`, `tick(15)` and assert
exact wake ordering with no real time involved and nothing to flake. Both M1
acceptance criteria are checked that way, in `tests.wasm` and again against the
real `kernel.wasm` in the smoke test.

§3.4 is amended to say so. The rounding in `tick`'s return is deliberately
upward, so the host never wakes before a deadline and re-arms for the remaining
fraction of a millisecond.

### Cancellation rides in the promise

§8.1 asks that `CancelToken` participate in every awaitable from this milestone
on. The obvious reading is a parameter — `sleep_ms(500, token)` — but a rule
enforced by remembering to pass an argument is not enforced at all, and it puts
the token in every signature in the system.

Instead the promise carries a `CancelState *`, and every awaiter's
`await_suspend` is templated on the promise type:

```cpp
template <class P> bool await_suspend(std::coroutine_handle<P> h) {
    w_.cancel = h.promise().cancel;
```

The compiler hands `await_suspend` a `coroutine_handle<promise_type>`, so an
awaiter can reach the *awaiting* coroutine's state without being told about it.
`Task`'s own awaiter copies the pointer from parent to child, which is where
§3.6's "cancellation propagates down the tree" comes from: it is one assignment,
made structurally, rather than a tree walk. The cost is that every awaitable in
the kernel must be awaited from a `Task` — acceptable, since that is what a
process is.

Killing sets the flag and, if the tree is suspended, pulls its waiter out of the
timer queue or wake table and puts it back on the ready queue. It then resumes
normally, sees the flag, and returns `Err(Error::Cancelled)`. Nothing is
destroyed from outside: the coroutine unwinds by returning, exactly as §3.6
requires, and its destructors run on the ordinary path. A task that is on the
ready queue rather than suspended needs no special handling — its next
`await_suspend` sees the flag and declines to suspend.

That propagation only works if errors actually propagate, and here M0 had left a
trap: `TRY` expands to a plain `return`, which is ill-formed inside a coroutine.
`CO_TRY` and `CO_TRY_VOID` are the same macros with `co_return`, and they live
beside `TRY` so the trap and its fix are read together. A process root is
different — it converts the error to an exit code rather than propagating it —
so the demo and the test tasks check the `Result` explicitly instead.

### The waiter lives in the coroutine frame

§3.3 describes the suspended-task table as `HashMap<u32, coroutine_handle<>>`.
What is stored is a `Waiter *` instead: a small record holding the handle, the
cancel state, the token, and room for the payload that `wake(token, ptr, len)`
already promises to deliver.

The record lives *inside* the suspended coroutine's frame — it is a member of
the awaiter, which the language guarantees stays alive across the suspension. So
registering a wait allocates nothing, and `wake()` has somewhere to put a
payload that the awaiter can read on resume without a second lookup. Nothing
about the table's shape changes; it just has a value type with more than one
field in it.

The cost of a pointer into a frame is that destroying the frame must not leave
it behind, so every awaiter deregisters in its destructor. That is the one rule
this design has to get right, and it is what makes `sched_reset()` — and, later,
killing a process mid-await — safe rather than a use-after-free.

`wake()` only queues. It never resumes a coroutine, so an event arriving from JS
in the middle of a `tick()` cannot re-enter the scheduler. An unknown token is
ignored rather than an error: a wake arriving after its task was cancelled is
normal traffic, not a fault.

### Scheduler state is allocated, not static

A `Vec` or `HashMap` at namespace scope has a non-trivial destructor, and clang
registers those with `__cxa_atexit` from the static-init function — which
`--no-entry` never calls, but which still references a symbol nothing provides.
Under M0's deliberate removal of `--allow-undefined` that is a link error, and
rightly so.

So the scheduler's state is one struct behind a pointer, built on first use. The
global is a plain pointer, there is no static initialisation to worry about, and
the reset that unit tests need between cases falls out for free: destroy the
struct and drop the pointer. Its destructor runs jobs down first, so suspended
frames are destroyed while the queues they point into are still alive.

### Queues sized for the actual workload

The ready queue is a `Vec` with a head cursor rather than a deque: it is drained
to empty on every tick, so the cursor never travels far and the storage is
reused rather than reallocated.

The timer queue is a `Vec` sorted with the earliest deadline last, so firing
pops from the back in O(1) and inserting is a bubble through a list that is a
handful of entries long in any real workload. A binary heap would improve the
insert and make the removal worse — and removal by waiter is exactly what
cancellation needs, which is a linear scan in a heap too.

Both are honest bets on scale rather than defaults, and both are contained: the
ready queue and timer queue are private to `sched.cpp` and can be replaced
without touching an awaitable.

### `HashMap`, shaped by the wake table

Open addressing with linear probing, power-of-two capacity, tombstones, doubling
at three quarters full. Integer keys go through murmur3's finalizer, because
sequential wake tokens are the primary key type and the identity hash would turn
the table into a single long probe run. There is an FNV-1a overload for `Str`
keys, which the M3 program registry will want.

Slots are one array of `{key, value, state}` rather than parallel arrays. The
kernel's tables are small and looked up one key at a time, so the cache argument
for splitting them does not apply, and one array is half the allocation
bookkeeping. Insertion returns `false` on OOM in the same style as `Vec`.

### `sleep_ms` is a `Task`, and that costs a frame

The awaitable underneath `sleep_ms` is enough on its own — `co_await Sleep(500)`
would work and allocate nothing. It is still wrapped in a `Task<Result<void>>`,
because §3.3's "every syscall is one of these" is worth more than one
allocation: syscalls compose, cancel and propagate errors uniformly precisely
because they are all the same type. §8.2 says the allocator is built for
coroutine frames as its primary workload, so this is spending exactly what that
was built to spend.

### The demo, and what the smoke test now proves

`init` spawns two tasks that sleep past each other — a at 10 ms and 30 ms, b at
15 ms and 25 ms. They cost a few hundred bytes of the budget and they earn it
twice: a bare page shows the scheduler working with no shell to drive it, and
the smoke test drives `tick()` on a synthetic clock and asserts both the log
order and the exact sequence of returned delays. The first acceptance criterion
is therefore checked against the shipping binary, not only against `tests.wasm`.
M3's shell replaces them.

M0's `coroutine_ok()` boot self-check is gone. It existed to prove the shim
linked and ran; the demo now does that far more thoroughly, and one of the two
had to go.

---

## M0 — Nucleus

The first milestone: a freestanding wasm build, the `<coroutine>` shim, the
allocator, the base core types, and one line of output in a browser tab. 4,013
bytes of `kernel.wasm`, against a 32 KiB budget.

### The build command line changed in three ways

Appendix C of the concept document records a compiler invocation verified before
any code existed. Building something real against it turned up three problems,
all confirmed by compiling and instantiating modules rather than by reading
documentation.

**`-Wl,--export-dynamic` is not a reliable way to export.** In a test module it
exported the mangled `operator new` and `operator delete` while silently
dropping a plain `extern "C" start()`. Whatever rule it follows, it is not
"export what I wrote", and a build system whose ABI surface is decided by linker
heuristics is a bad foundation. Every export is now named individually with
`__attribute__((export_name("...")))`, wrapped in the `BRAAM_EXPORT` macro. The
`used` attribute goes with it, because `--gc-sections` would otherwise drop a
function nothing calls. The result is an export section that contains exactly
what we asked for and nothing else, which is a thing the smoke test can assert
against.

**`-Wl,--allow-undefined` is not just unnecessary — it is actively bad here.**
Its purpose is to let unresolved symbols become imports. But imports are now
declared explicitly with
`__attribute__((import_module("host"), import_name("...")))`, so there is
nothing left for it to resolve. Dropping it converts a whole class of mistake
from runtime to link time: a stray libc call — `strlen`, say, reached through
some header we did not expect — used to become a silent import that traps when
first called. It is now `wasm-ld: error: undefined symbol: strlen` before the
binary exists. For a project whose entire premise is "we link nothing we did not
write", having the linker enforce that claim is worth more than the flag it
costs.

The related worry, that `memcpy` and `memset` would leak in as imports, turned
out to be unfounded: `__wasm_bulk_memory__` is on by default for this target, so
LLVM lowers them inline to `memory.copy` and `memory.fill`. A 4 KiB struct copy
produced a module whose only import was `host.log`. No hand-written `mem*`
functions are needed, and if that ever changes the missing symbol is now a link
error rather than a mystery trap.

**`--no-default-config` and `-Wl,--stack-first` are new.** The first suppresses
`bin/clang++.cfg`, which unconditionally injects `--sysroot=.../wasi-sysroot`.
It is harmless under `-nostdlib -nostdinc++`, but the whole point of using this
SDK as a bare clang is that nothing of its comes along uninvited, and
determinism costs one flag. The second moves the shadow stack below the data
segment. By default the stack sits above the data and grows down into it, so an
overflow quietly corrupts globals; with `--stack-first` it grows down towards
address zero and runs off the bottom of linear memory, which traps. Concept.md
§8.4 asks that this class of bug fail loudly, and this is the same argument
applied to the stack.

### The coroutine shim

Appendix C is right that libc++'s `<coroutine>` cannot be used freestanding, and
right about the shim being roughly 25 lines. One detail it does not mention, and
which costs an afternoon if missed: `std::coroutine_traits` must be defined, not
merely declared. A forward declaration compiles fine until the first coroutine,
which then fails with "implicit instantiation of undefined template". The
primary template needs its body —
`using promise_type = typename R::promise_type;`.

`coroutine_handle<P>` derives publicly from `coroutine_handle<void>` rather than
holding a pointer and offering a conversion operator, which is how libc++ does
it. Inheritance gives the derived-to-base conversion for free; writing the
conversion operator as well earns a `-Wclass-conversion` warning, because it can
never be selected.

`noop_coroutine` is included even though nothing uses it yet. `Task<T>`'s
`final_suspend` in M1 will want it as the "resume nobody" case in symmetric
transfer, and the shim is the wrong place to be adding pieces under time
pressure.

The test suite pins down more of the shim's behaviour than M0 strictly needs,
deliberately. It checks that destroying a *suspended* coroutine runs the
destructors of locals held across the suspend point — which is precisely the
contract cancellation depends on in M1 (§8.1) — and that `await_suspend`
returning a handle transfers control to it, which is what makes `Task<T>`
chaining work without growing the stack.

### The allocator: spans, not headers

Coroutine frames are the hot path (§8.2), and frames are freed through
`operator delete`, which does not always know the size. The usual answer is a
header word before each block recording its size class; the usual cost is that a
16-byte allocation becomes 32 bytes once alignment is preserved, which is a 100%
overhead on the most common size.

Instead, linear memory is carved into 64 KiB **spans**, and each span serves
exactly one size class. A side table maps span index to class, so `free(p)`
finds the class with `span_class[p >> 16]`. There is no per-allocation header at
all, 16-byte alignment falls out of the class sizes, and sized and unsized
`delete` are the same O(1) operation. This is the structure jemalloc and
mimalloc use, for the same reason.

Allocation within a span is a bump pointer with a per-class free list in front
of it, so a freshly claimed span costs nothing to prepare — no carving loop
threading 4,096 blocks onto a list before the first allocation can be served.

Allocations over 512 bytes take whole span runs. Their free list is
address-ordered with coalescing on insert, which is the old K&R arrangement.
Coalescing is not needed for correctness, and skipping it would have been
simpler, but `Vec` growth reallocates repeatedly and each cycle would strand a
run that nothing could ever reuse. Address-ordered insertion makes both
neighbours cheap to find, and the free-run list is short in practice because
small allocations never touch it.

The span table is a fixed `u8[4096]`, capping the heap at 256 MiB. Sizing it for
wasm32's full 4 GiB would cost 64 KiB of zero-initialised memory for a limit no
browser tab will approach. The array is `.bss`, so it costs nothing in the
binary either way; the cap is about honesty, not bytes, and raising it is a
one-line change.

One consequence worth knowing before it looks like a bug: reserved memory grows
in 64 KiB units *per size class*. Boot reserves 320 KiB for five allocations,
because a `Vec` growing through 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256-byte capacities touches
five different classes and each claims a span. This is fine — the memory is
reserved, not used, and steady-state behaviour is what matters — but the number
surprises on first sight.

### The heap base convention

Concept.md §3.4 fixes `init(heap_base)`, but in M0 the host has no way to know
where the kernel's data ends. Rather than export the layout to JS so JS can hand
it straight back, `init` treats a base of `0` as "use the linker's
`__heap_base`". The signature stays as specified, the host stays ignorant of the
kernel's memory map, and M8 — where an isolated process really is handed a base
chosen by its parent — needs no ABI change.

### Errors, and the shape of `TRY`

`TRY(expr)` is a statement expression (`({ ... })`), a GNU extension that clang
implements, which is why `CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS` is `ON` and the standard is
`gnu++20` rather than `c++20`. The alternative — a macro that assigns into a
caller-declared variable — reads badly at every call site, and this is a
construct that will appear in nearly every kernel function.

Early return needs a value convertible to *any* `Result<U, E>`, so errors travel
as a small `ErrTag<E>` returned by `Err(e)`, which each `Result` has a
converting constructor for. That is the standard trick and it costs nothing at
runtime.

`TRY_VOID` exists because `TRY` unwraps a value and `Result<void, E>` has none.
Two macros is mildly unfortunate; the alternative was making
`Result<void, E>::value()` return a dummy, which would be worse.

### Verification

Tests run headlessly under Node, which stands in for the browser perfectly well:
a freestanding module needs nothing browser-specific to instantiate.
`test/run.mjs` has two modes.

The `--kernel` mode asserts the *exact* import and export lists. This looks
pedantic for two imports and two exports, but the ABI is the thing most likely
to drift silently, and an unexpected import is precisely the signature of an
accidental libc dependency. The check costs one line and catches a category of
problem that is otherwise invisible until runtime.

The `--tests` mode drives `tests.wasm`, a separate binary linking the same core
library. Two binaries rather than a compile-time flag, so test code can never
count against the kernel's size budget and the number the budget checks is the
number that ships.

`tests.wasm` lists its cases explicitly in `main.cpp` rather than
self-registering at static init. Self-registration needs `__wasm_call_ctors`,
which `--no-entry` leaves uncalled, and that question is better settled in M3
where the program registry (§3.6) actually depends on it.

Writing the tests found two real bugs, which is the argument for having written
them: `Str::split` read its own fields after overwriting them when the output
parameter aliased `*this` — the natural way to write a tokenising loop — and the
first attempt to assert that coroutine frames come from the kernel heap failed
because clang had elided the allocation entirely. The second is not a bug in the
allocator but in the test: heap allocation elision is a permitted optimisation,
so the test now routes the frame through a `noinline` factory that lets the
handle escape, which is the situation the scheduler will actually create in M1.

### Size budget

32,768 bytes for `kernel.wasm`, from Concept.md's "~30 KB" rounded to something
page-friendly. M0 uses 12% of it. The number is deliberately not tight: its job
is to make growth *visible* and deliberate, and a budget that has to be edited
every commit stops being read. CI prints the figure into the job summary on
every run, so the trend is visible without anyone going looking.
