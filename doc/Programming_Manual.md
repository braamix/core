# Writing a program for Braam

Every command in Braam is a wasm binary of its own, and nothing about that is
private to this repository. A program is one C++ file, one `#include`, and one
function; it is compiled by a plain clang against a handful of headers, linked
against two static libraries, and stamped with a note saying which process ABI
it was built for. This document is the whole of what somebody outside the tree
needs.

It is the out-of-tree half of [System_Calls.md](System_Calls.md) §12, which
describes the same thing from inside `src/cmd/`. The mechanism underneath — what
a syscall is, how the kernel answers it, what a descriptor is — is that
document; this one is the build and the API.

---

## 1. Installing the SDK

From a source tree:

```
make install                 # /usr/local if it is writable, else ~/.local
make install PREFIX=/opt/braam
```

Or unpack `braam-sdk-<version>.zip` from a release anywhere at all. The tree is
relocatable: the CMake package finds its own prefix by walking up from itself,
so an unpacked archive is a working SDK with nothing installed and no
environment variable set.

Either way, this is what you get:

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `include/braam/{kernel,fs,proc,ui,math}/` | the headers a program includes |
| `lib/braam/libbraam_proc.a` | the process runtime: the allocator, the strings, the task scheduler, the syscall wrappers |
| `lib/braam/libbraam_ui.a` | the layout layer, for a program that paints |
| `lib/braam/libbraam_math.a` | musl's libm, for a program that asks for it (§6) |
| `lib/braam/libbraam_compat_pure.a` | the opt-in port kit, for a *ported* C program (doc/Compat.md) |
| `include/braam/compat/include/` | the kit's system header names — on a `PORT` target's path and no other's |
| `lib/cmake/braam/wasm32-unknown-unknown.cmake` | the toolchain file |
| `lib/cmake/braam/braamConfig.cmake` | `find_package(braam)` |
| `lib/cmake/braam/BraamProgram.cmake` | `braam_add_program()` |
| `libexec/braam/stamp.py` | the post-link stamp |
| `libexec/braam/mkpkg.py` | the package builder (§3.1), with `pack.py` beside it |
| `libexec/braam/mkindex.py` | the publisher's tools (§3.1): `mkanchor.py`, `signindex.py` and `ed25519.py` beside it |
| `share/braam/examples/hello/` | the example below |
| `share/doc/braam/Programming_Manual.md` | this file |

You also need what Braam itself needs: a clang with the wasm32 target and
`wasm-ld` beside it (`brew install llvm lld`, or `apt install clang lld llvm`),
CMake 3.24, and Python 3 for the stamp. Nothing is taken from the clang
distribution but the compiler and its freestanding headers — `<stdint.h>`,
`<stddef.h>`, `<stdarg.h>`, `<limits.h>`, `<float.h>` and `<endian.h>`, which
declare no functions and pull in no runtime. No sysroot, so `<stdio.h>` does not
resolve unless you ask for the port kit. There is no
libc *under* the system and no way to put one there. There is a libm, and there
is an opt-in port kit for ported C; §6 says how to link either.

## 2. Hello, world

```cpp
// hello.cpp
#include "proc/io.h"

Task<i32> proc_main(Args args)
{
    Str who = "world";
    if (args.size() > 1)
        who = args[1];

    if ((co_await write_all(SYS_STDOUT, "Hello, ")).is_err() ||
        (co_await write_all(SYS_STDOUT, who)).is_err() ||
        (co_await write_all(SYS_STDOUT, "!\n")).is_err())
        co_return 1;

    co_return 0;
}
```

```cmake
# CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.24)
project(hello LANGUAGES CXX)

find_package(braam REQUIRED)

braam_add_program(NAME hello SOURCES hello.cpp)
```

```
cmake -B build --toolchain <prefix>/lib/cmake/braam/wasm32-unknown-unknown.cmake
cmake --build build
```

`build/hello.wasm` is the program.

**The toolchain file is the one thing you have to name, and only on that first
command.** It is what makes the compiler a wasm32 one, and it points
`find_package` at the SDK it was taken from, so nothing else has to be spelled
out — not the include path, not the libraries, not `stamp.py`. `--toolchain` is
CMake's shorthand for `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=`.

CMake chooses the compiler when a project is first configured, so a build
directory configured *without* it holds a host compiler and cannot be repaired
by adding the flag: you get `sizeof(usize) == 4, "wasm32"` and
`unknown type name '__externref_t'` from the headers, or, since
`find_package(braam)` refuses a non-wasm32 compiler, a message saying so. Delete
the build directory and configure again.

`braam_add_program(NAME <n> SOURCES <...> [LIBS <...>])` is the same function
`src/cmd/` builds the system's own thirty-six programs with. It links
`braam::proc` and `braam::flags` — `braam::math` is asked for by name — links
with `--import-memory` so the memory cap is the kernel's, and runs `stamp.py`
over the result. `LIBS` names anything else the program is made of. The CMake
target it defines is `bin_<name>` — the file is `<name>.wasm`, and the prefix is
there because a program may be called `test` or `install`.

---

## 3. Running it

A program does not have to be in the system image to run. `exec` resolves a path
through the ordinary filesystem against the calling process's working directory,
and accepts anything carrying a well-formed stamp — so a `.wasm` that arrives at
runtime is a command.

**Through the file picker.** At the prompt, `fimport`, and choose `hello.wasm`.
It lands in `/import/`:

```
$ fimport
/import/hello.wasm
$ /import/hello.wasm Serge
Hello, Serge!
```

**Over the network**, into the one durable filesystem:

```
$ curl https://example.org/hello.wasm > /home/hello
$ /home/hello
Hello, world!
```

A bare word with no slash in it is searched for along `PATH`, which is `/bin` at
boot — a read-only view of the archive loaded beside the kernel, so putting a
program *there* does mean rebuilding the image. Anywhere else needs nothing but
a `PATH` that names it: `PATH=/home:$PATH` and the bare name runs.

One thing to know while iterating: the host caches a compiled module by path, so
replacing a program at a path that has already been run in this page does not
take effect until a reload. Write the new one beside the old, or reload.

### 3.1 Shipping it as a package

A program that is to be installed rather than carried about is a zip
([Package_Formats.md](Package_Formats.md) §5), and `braam_add_package` builds
one:

```cmake
braam_add_program(NAME hello SOURCES hello.cpp)

braam_add_package(NAME hello VERSION 1.0-r0
                  FIELD "T=a greeting"
                  FILES $<TARGET_FILE:bin_hello>=bin/hi)
```

`FILES` takes §10's `<src>=<entry>` pairs — a local file, and where it sits
inside the package. The target is `pkg_<name>` and the file is
`<name>-<version>.zip`; it is **not in `ALL`**, so `cmake --build build --target
pkg_hello` is what packs it. `FIELD <L>=<value>` sets any §3.2 letter, `T` and
`D` being the two worth setting; `.PKGINFO` is written for you and only `P` and
`V` are required, which `NAME` and `VERSION` are. **Quote a field whose value
has a space in it**, or CMake splits it into arguments of its own.

**`bin/` is what reaches `PATH`.** Every flat entry of it becomes a link in the
installed generation's `bin/` (§8.3) and a `cmd:<entry>` provide (§6.1), and the
default `PATH` is `/bin:/pkg/bin`. The entry's leaf is the command's name, so
`bin/hi` is typed `hi` — name the entry as the command, without `.wasm`, and
keep it flat: `bin/sub/tool` yields no command at all.

Versions are apk's grammar (§7): `1.0-r0`, and `1.0-r1` supersedes it.

**The zip is installable on its own**, which is how to try one before there is
anywhere to publish it: `pkg install ./hello-1.0-r0.zip`, or the URL of wherever
it sits. `pkg` says `unverified: no index vouches for it`, since none does, and
everything else runs as it will after publishing. That is a person choosing to
install software they have in their hands (Package_Management.md §7.1) and is
not a way to hand one to anybody else — nothing has been signed, the install
records `G: 0`, and `pkg verify` reports it `unvouched` from then on.

*Distributing* it is the other thing. `pkg` fetches only what a signed index
lists, so publishing means a repository — keys, an anchor and an index, which is
Package_Formats.md §10 end to end. The tools that do it ship here too,
in `libexec/braam/`: `ed25519.py` for keys, `mkanchor.py` for the anchor,
`mkindex.py` for the index, `signindex.py` for a `Y:` line over a body. They are
the only thing in the SDK that wants a Python package —
`pip3 install cryptography` — and only the ones that sign.

```
mkindex.py --out index --url https://packages.example/braam \
    --version 41 --expiry 1790000000000 \
    --description 'Example packages' --sign index.key \
    hello-1.0-r0.zip
```

`--url` must equal the line in the client's `/etc/repositories`, byte for byte,
and `--version` must rise at every publication or a client refuses the index as
a rollback. `C`, `S` and the `cmd:` provides are read out of the zips, so the
index is never hand-written.

---

## 4. Writing a script

**Not every command has to be a binary.** `/bin/sh` is a Bourne shell —
variables, `if`, the three loops, `case`, functions, globbing, `$( )`,
here-documents, `test` and `trap` — so a command whose work is running other
commands is a text file, and needs no toolchain at all. The grammar is
Concept.md §4.5, and [Shell.md](Shell.md) is the whole shell in detail.

Write it anywhere the filesystem reaches — `edit` is in `/bin` — and run it by
name after `sh`:

```
$ cat /home/report.sh
show() {
  echo "$1: $(wc < $1)"
}
trap 'echo done' 0
for f in /home/*.txt
do
  case $f in
  *draft*) continue ;;
  esac
  show $f
done
$ sh /home/report.sh
/home/notes.txt:      12      84     501
/home/todo.txt:       3       9      46
done
```

Arguments after the file are `$1` onwards and the file itself is `$0`, exactly
as `sh -c 'cmd' name args` takes its own after the command string. `sh -s` reads
a script off standard input instead, which is what a pipeline into the shell
uses. The status the script leaves with is the status `sh` exits with, so a
script composes into a pipeline like anything else.

**`#!` works, within three bounds.** A file whose first line is `#!` followed by
an absolute path is executable, so `./script.sh` and a script installed in
`/bin` both run:

```
$ cat greet
#!/bin/sh
echo greetings $1
$ ./greet world
greetings world
```

What is instantiated is the interpreter, entered with itself, its one argument
if the line carried one, the resolved path of the script, and then your own
arguments — so `$0` is the script and `$1` onwards are yours, exactly as
`sh file` gives them. The interpreter must be **absolute**, since `PATH` is the
caller's and a bare word would name a different interpreter depending on who ran
the script; the lookup is **one level deep**, so an interpreter that is itself a
script is refused; and the first line must end within 128 bytes.
`test -x` answers by the same two rules, and a script costs one process rather
than two.

**One limit remains, and it is deliberate.** A script is **parsed whole before
any of it runs**, as `. file` is, so a syntax error on the last line means the
first line does not run either. That is the price of the shell keeping its
standard input free for the script to read from, which is what lets
`while read l; do …; done` inside one work against a pipe.

The rest of what a script can and cannot do — no subshell isolation, no compound
command in the background — is §4.5's table. `export` does reach a child: an
exported variable is copied into every command's environment at spawn, and a
nested `sh` reads it back into its own table.

---

## 5. The shape of a program

`proc_main` is what a program defines, and its return value is the exit status.
Everything that would block is a `co_await`, because a process is a coroutine
and nothing anywhere blocks — that is Concept.md §2.1 and it reaches all the way
down here.

A filter is the shape most programs have:

```cpp
Task<i32> proc_main(Args args)
{
    Input in(args.tail(), SYS_STDIN, "count"); // the named files, or stdin

    usize lines = 0;
    LineReader lr(in);
    String line;
    for (;;) {
        Result<bool> r = co_await lr.next(line);
        if (r.is_err())
            co_return r.error() == Error::Cancelled ? 130 : 1;
        if (!r.value())
            break;                         // end of input
        lines++;
    }

    Buf<24> b;
    b.put(lines).put('\n');
    if ((co_await write_all(SYS_STDOUT, b.str())).is_err())
        co_return 1;
    co_return 0;
}
```

Five conventions there, and every program in `src/cmd/` follows them:

- `Input` decides files-or-stdin in its constructor, and opens each named file
  only when the read reaches it, closing it before the next. A file that will
  not open prints `count: <path>: <why>` on stderr itself and comes back as an
  ordinary error, so it is reported where the reading stopped rather than before
  any output.
- **`Error::Closed` is a normal end of input**, not a failure.
- **`Error::Cancelled` is `^C`**, and the exit status for it is 130.
- Output is formatted into a stack `Buf<N>`, which never allocates. Where a
  program writes *rows* — a line per entry, a row per process — the `Buf` goes
  to a `File` (`proc/file.h`), which is what stops each one costing a syscall.
  Where the whole output is one write, `write_all` is already that, and a
  `File` would only add a buffer to flush.

- **A usage message is a block, and asking for one is not an error.** The text
  is a `Usage:` heading, the synopsis indented four spaces, then `Options:`
  and a row per letter. `usage_asked(USAGE)` writes it to stdout and returns 0;
  `usage_error(USAGE)` writes it to stderr and returns 2. A program whose whole
  command line is empty, or is `-h` or `--help`, is being asked rather than
  getting it wrong:

  ```cpp
  if (args.size() == 1 || help_asked(args))
      co_return co_await usage_asked(USAGE);
  ```

  A program that does real work with no arguments — `cat`, `ls`, `ps` — drops
  the first half and keeps `help_asked`. Where `-h` is already the program's own
  (`ls`, `df`), only `--help` asks.

There is no `main`, no `argc`/`argv`, no `printf`, no `errno` and no exceptions.
(A *ported* program may have the middle three: `braam::compat`, §6.)
`args[0]` is the name the program was invoked by; `args.tail()` is everything
after it.

---

## 6. The API

### `proc/io.h` — one wrapper per syscall

Each is a `Task<Result<T>>`. `Result` carries an `Error` and is unpacked with
`.is_err()`, `.error()` and `.value()`; `CO_TRY` propagates one.

| Group | What is there |
| --- | --- |
| Streams | `write_all(fd, Str)`, `read_chunk(fd)`, `read_some(fd, max)`, `close_fd(fd)` |
| Files | `open_at(path, flags)`, `open_read`, `read_file`, `stat_of`, `list_dir`, `make_dir`, `make_dir_all`, `remove_path`, `touch_path`, `make_link`, `read_link`, `rename_path`, `seek_fd(fd, off, whence)`, `truncate_fd(fd, n)`, `copy_file`, `copy_tree`, `TreeWalk(root)` |
| Directory | `cwd_get()`, `cwd_set(path)` — this process's own, inherited from whoever spawned it |
| Children | `make_pipe()`, `spawn(Args, ChildIo, const Args *env)`, `wait_child(pid)`, `kill_child(pid)`, `set_fg(pid)` |
| Terminal | `tty_of(fd)`, `keys_claim(bool)`, `screen_claim(bool)`, `key_read()`, `cursor_get()`, `cursor_set(x, y, on)`, `style_set(fg, bg, attrs)`, `cursor_echo(x, y, cur, flags, runs)` |
| System | `storage_of()`, `sleep_for(ms)`, `clock_now()` — and from `proc/rt.h`, synchronous rather than `Task`s: `proc_pid()`, `proc_now()`, `proc_random()` |
| Environment | `proc_env(name)`, `proc_env_count()`, `proc_env_at(i)` — from `proc/rt.h`, and not syscalls |
| Host services | `fetch_url(url, spec)`, `ws_connect(url)`, `clip_get`, `clip_put`, `pick`, `pick_open`, `fexport`, `verify_sig`, `inflate` |
| Helpers | `errln(who, what, why)`, `Input`, `LineReader`, `next_line`, `next_field` |

A buffered stream over any of these is `proc/file.h`, below — the layer a port
from Unix wants where this one is the layer a program written here wants.

Everything that is a stream of bytes comes back as a descriptor, so there is
nothing new to learn for any of it: a fetched body is read with `read_chunk`
until `Err(Closed)` and closed with `close_fd`, and a WebSocket is written with
`write_all`.

The environment came in with `_start`, so reading it costs nothing:
`proc_env("HOME")` reports the value or an empty `Str`, and `proc_env_at` walks
the lot as `NAME=value` words. It is a copy taken at the spawn and **cannot be
changed** — there is no `setenv`, and nothing a program does reaches its parent
or a child already running. What a program *can* choose is what its own children
get: `spawn(argv, io)` hands them this process's, and `spawn(argv, io, &env)`
hands them exactly the words named. `/bin/env` is the worked example of both.

**One word of it is the kernel's**: `PATH` is what `spawn` resolves a bare
command name along, so the environment a program hands a child decides where
that child is looked for. `spawn(argv, io)` searches what this process was
given; `spawn(argv, io, &env)` searches whatever `env` says, and an `env` naming
no `PATH` searches `/bin`. A name with a `/` in it is a path and is never
searched.

`stat_of` answers a `FileInfo{kind, size, mtime}` and `list_dir` a `DirEntry`
each, which is the same three fields plus a name. The `mtime` is milliseconds
since the epoch, and **0 means the filesystem keeps none**: every directory,
since OPFS has no timestamp on one, and all of `/proc` and `/dev`, which are
generated rather than stored. Compare two of them to tell which file is newer;
render one with `civil()` from `proc/time.h`, which `date` and `ls -l` both use.
`touch_path` moves a file's mtime to now and is the only thing that can — there
is no setter in OPFS, so a store that cannot be made to restamp answers
`Unsupported`.

`/dev` holds `null`, `random`, `urandom` and `zero` — devices rather than files,
and they read like one: `stat_of` says 0 as Linux does, `seek_fd` with
`SYS_SEEK_END` fails because there is no end to seek to, and `truncate_fd` fails
because there is no length to set. A read of `null` is 0 bytes, which is the end
of input; a read of the other three is met in full for as long as you read. All
four also open with `SYS_O_WRITE` and take every byte written, keeping none —
`> /dev/null` is a sink, and two of them in one command or one pipeline are two
descriptors that do not collide. Read `random` or `urandom` for a nonce or a key
— `random` is the host's own bytes, one draw per read; `urandom` is a generator
in the kernel the host seeded once, so a long stream costs no host call at all.
`proc_random()` is the cheaper way to a single `u32`.

`kind` is `SYS_KIND_FILE`, `SYS_KIND_DIR` or `SYS_KIND_LINK`. Everything above
that names a path **follows a symbolic link**, except `remove_path`, which drops
the link rather than what it points at, and `read_link`, which is the only way
to see a target. `stat_of(path, false)` reports a final link itself — that is
how `test -h` is written, and the only way to stat one that dangles. A listing
never resolves, so a `DirEntry` says `SYS_KIND_LINK` whatever the link points
at: walk a tree on `SYS_KIND_DIR` alone and it cannot follow a link out of the
tree, which is why neither `ls -R` nor the shell's globber needs a cycle guard.
`make_link` stores the target as written, so it may dangle and a relative one
reads against the directory the link is in.

`make_dir` is one level and `Err(Exists)` on a leaf that is already there.
`make_dir_all` is the walk over the components — what `mkdir -p` is — creating
each missing one and tolerating a directory that stands already. A leaf standing
as anything else is `Err(Exists)` still, and a file part-way along fails the
component below it.

`TreeWalk(root)` is the walk over a whole tree: `next(path, entry)` reports
everything under `root` pre-order — a directory before what is in it — until it
answers `ok(false)`. The stack is explicit and on the heap, so depth costs no
coroutine frame and there is no ceiling to declare; `root` itself is not
reported, since a caller that wants it has already stat'd it. A directory that
will not list is an `Err` naming itself in `at()`, and that level is dropped —
report it and call again to walk the rest, or return and stop. `next` is an
awaiter rather than a `Task`, for the reason `File`'s reads are: an entry the
walk has already listed must not enter a coroutine. `copy_tree`, `/bin/find`
and `/bin/du` are all written over it.

`copy_tree(from, to)` merges: `to` may already be a directory, and so may any
directory under it, which is what `cp -r a b` needs when `b/a` is there
already. Only the *kinds* have to agree. A file is written over, a link is
removed and recreated, and a directory meeting a file or a link is
`Err(Exists)` — the distinction `make_dir`'s own `Err(Exists)` cannot make,
which is why the helper stats after it. A file meeting a directory is the
open's `Err(IsDir)`. `-n` and `-i` are `/bin/cp`'s decisions about the name it
was given, not rules the walk carries.

`rename_path(from, to)` follows neither end and replaces the destination — and
its `Err(Unsupported)` is an instruction rather than a failure: the store cannot
move *this* one, so copy and remove instead. That is the answer for a move
across mounts, for a directory, and on any engine whose OPFS has no
`FileSystemHandle.move()`. Every other error is real. `/bin/mv` is the worked
example, and the reason to bother trying: a rename keeps the mtime, and a copy
cannot.

`tty_of(SYS_STDOUT)` is how a program lays its output out: it reports whether
that descriptor is the terminal and, if it is, how wide. The geometry is zero
for a pipe or a file, so a program that formats for a terminal falls back to one
item per line rather than inventing a width. `/bin/ls` is the worked example.

### `proc/file.h` — buffered streams, in place of `stdio.h`

`io.h` is one syscall per call, which is right for a program that reads a chunk
and writes a line, and wrong for one ported from Unix that reads a character at
a time — at 34–45 µs each, `getchar()` over a megabyte is forty seconds. `File`
is the layer over it: a buffer, runes rather than bytes, and a sticky error.

```cpp
#include "proc/file.h"

Task<i32> proc_main(Args)
{
    File &in  = File::stdin();
    File &out = File::stdout();

    while (Result<char32_t> c = co_await in.get())
        co_await out.put(rune_lower(c.value()));

    if ((co_await out.flush()).is_err())
        co_return 1;
    if (in.failed())
        co_return in.err() == Error::Cancelled ? 130 : 1;
    co_return 0;
}
```

That is `while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) putchar(tolower(c));`, and it is the
same shape for the same reason: **the error is sticky**. `get()` returns
`Result<char32_t>`, whose `explicit operator bool` is what the `while` reads,
and `Err(Error::Closed)` is end of input — but the same error is also latched on
the `File`, so the loop needs no check inside it and `in.failed()` afterwards is
`ferror()`. `in.err()` is `Error(0)` while nothing has gone wrong, `in.eof()` is
`Closed`, and `clear_err()` resets both.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Opening | `File::open(path, FileMode::Read \| Write \| Append \| Update)`, `File::of(fd, mode)`, `File(Input &)`, `File::stdin()`, `File::stdout()`, `File::stderr()` |
| Reading | `get()` one rune, `unget(c)`, `read(span)`, `getline(String &, keep_nl)` |
| Scanning | `skip_space()`, `scan_lit(c)`, `scan_token(String &, width)`, `scan_until(String &, stop, width)`, `scan_i64(base, width)`, `scan_u64(base, width)` |
| Writing | `put(c)`, `write(Str)`, `flush()` |
| The rest | `seek(off, whence)`, `close()`, `detach()`, `err()`, `eof()`, `failed()`, `clean()`, `clear_err()`, `set_buffering()`, `reserve(n)` |

`get()` decodes UTF-8, so what comes back is a codepoint however many bytes it
took, and a sequence that end of input cut short is one U+FFFD rather than a
silent truncation. `put()` encodes it again. `rune_lower` and `rune_upper` are
in `kernel/text.h` beside `utf8_encode` and `utf8_decode`; they cover ASCII,
Latin-1, Latin Extended-A, Greek and Cyrillic by range, and a mapping that is
not one codepoint for one comes back unchanged.

The scanning row is `scanf`'s conversions with the format string taken away:
nothing here takes `...`, errors are values, and a format defeats every check
the compiler could make. `scan_token` is `%s`, `scan_until` is `%[^set]`,
`scan_i64`/`scan_u64` are `%d %i %u %o %x` with `base` 0 meaning C's `0x`/`0b`/`0`
prefixes, and `width` is the field width. The same conversions over a `Str`
rather than a stream are in `kernel/text.h` — `scan_space`, `scan_i64`,
`scan_u64`, `scan_token`, `scan_until` — where `used` is the bytes taken, the
way `scan_f64`'s is.

Two rules they state and scanf does not. **Leading whitespace follows scanf**:
the numeric ones and `scan_token` skip it, `scan_until` does not. And they are
**one pass with no backtracking** — `scan_lit` puts its one byte back on a
mismatch, which is all the pushback the buffer promises, and a `scan_i64` that
took whitespace and a sign before finding no digit answers `Err(Invalid)`
rather than restoring them. The `Str` half has no such limit: `used` is 0 when
nothing matched, so a caller that wants to back up simply does not advance.

`get()`, `put()`, `read()`, `write()` and `getline()` are not `Task`s but
awaiters, so the common case — the buffer already holds a rune, a whole line, or
room for what is being written — allocates no coroutine frame at all, and a
slow-path frame that will not allocate becomes `Err(NoMemory)` rather than the
panic that `co_await` on a null `Task` gives. That is not only an allocation
saved. A `Task` that answers **without suspending** resumes its awaiting
coroutine on the awaiter's own stack, so a loop over an already-buffered stream
never returns to the trampoline and the shadow stack grows a frame an item:
`getline` as a `Task` died at four thousand lines. **A per-item loop wants an
awaiter with an `await_ready` fast path, not a `Task`** — `LineReader::next` and
`TreeWalk::next` in `io.h` are the same shape for the same reason.

Four rules, all of which bite:

- **The destructor does not flush.** A destructor cannot `co_await`. Flush with
  `flush()` or `close()`; failing that, the runtime flushes `stdout` and
  `stderr` after `proc_main` returns, which is the safety net and not the plan.
- **A buffered `File` owns its stream until `close()` or `detach()`.** It reads
  ahead, past where the kernel's own pushback could put the bytes back.
  `detach()` winds a seekable descriptor back and refuses on a pipe; a
  descriptor about to be named in a spawn wants `Buffering::None`.
- **`stdout` is line-buffered on the console and fully buffered otherwise**,
  decided by one `tty_of` on the first flush. `stderr` is unbuffered and
  allocates nothing. `set_buffering` overrides all of it.
- **The buffer is 512 bytes and the block is heap, but a `char buf[4096]` of
  your own is not.** A coroutine frame past 512 bytes costs a whole 64 KiB span.
  Read into a small span and let the `File` do the buffering, or say
  `reserve(SYS_READ_MAX)`, which is one span exactly — `/bin/cat` does both.

### `proc/time.h` — the calendar

`civil(secs)` turns seconds since the epoch into a `Civil{year, month, day,
hour, min, sec, weekday}`, with `TIME_MONTHS` and `TIME_DAYS` beside it for the
names. Pure — no syscall — so the wall clock and the timezone are the caller's
to fetch with `clock_now()` and add in. `date` and `ls -l` are the callers.

### `proc/opt.h` — the command line

`OptParse` reads bundled short flags (`-lR`), `--` to end them, and a flag that
takes a value (`-n5` or `-n 5`). It allocates nothing, and options end at the
first operand.

```cpp
constexpr Opts SPEC{ "lr", "n" }; // letters taken; those consuming a value
OptParse opts(args, SPEC);
Opt o;
for (;;) {
    Result<bool> more = opts.next(o);
    if (more.is_err())      // Invalid: an unknown letter, named in o.name
        co_return 2;        // NotFound: a valued letter with nothing after it
    if (!more.value())
        break;
    ...
}
Args paths = opts.rest();
```

`help_asked(args)` is here too: true when `-h` or `--help` is the whole command
line, so a file named `-h` is still an operand beside anything else.

Two rules about descriptors, both of which the kernel enforces rather than
trusts:

- **A descriptor named in a spawn is *moved* into the child.** That is what
  closes this side of a pipe, and therefore what lets the other side see an end
  of input. It must not be used after the spawn.
- **One user of a descriptor in one direction at a time.** A second concurrent
  read of the same descriptor is `Err(Perm)`.

A process may have up to `PROC_TASKS` syscalls outstanding at once — eight, one
per task; `proc_spawn(Task<i32>)` starts a second task, and the process ends
when the *root* task returns, whatever the others are doing.

### `proc/screen.h` and `ui/` — painting

A full-screen program claims the alternate screen and the keyboard, paints into
a `Grid` of its own, and sends the damage across in one syscall per frame:

```cpp
ProcScreen s;
co_await s.take_screen();
co_await s.take_keys();
Pane body = s.body();
body.write_at(0, 0, "hello");
co_await s.flush();
Key k = co_await s.next_key();
```

`Pane` clips, never wraps and never scrolls; `TextBuf` holds lines and
`TextView` scrolls a window over one. That is what `less` and `edit` are built
out of, and it links into the binary rather than living in the kernel. A resize
rides on every key reply, so there is no event to subscribe to.

Nothing gives a claim back on your behalf — but nothing has to: a process that
dies has its claims released by the kernel, because a killed program runs no
destructor.

**A second screen** is `attach()`, before either claim, naming a terminal from
`/proc/terms`:

```cpp
ProcScreen panel;
co_await panel.attach(1);      // Err(NotFound) on a page with one canvas
co_await panel.take_screen();
co_await panel.take_keys();
```

Its claims and its grid are its own, so a program may hold two at once. To watch
both, give each a task — `proc_spawn` above — since a task has one syscall
outstanding and a second `next_key()` on one screen is `Err(Perm)`. A resize
still arrives as `Err(Intr)` from `next_key()`, on both, and each instance has
already repaired its own grid by the time it reports one.

### Mathematics — `math/math.h` and `math/ftoa.h`

The one library a program asks for by name, because most do not want it:

```cmake
braam_add_program(NAME plot SOURCES plot.cpp LIBS braam::math)
```

`math/math.h` is C99 §7.12 for `double` and `float`: the classification macros
(`fpclassify`, `isnan`, `isinf`, `isfinite`, `isnormal`, `signbit`), the
rounding family, `frexp`/`ldexp`/`modf`/`scalbn`/`remquo`, the exponentials and
logarithms, `pow`, `cbrt`, `hypot`, the trigonometric and hyperbolic families
and their inverses, `erf`, `lgamma`, `tgamma`, and the Bessel functions. It is
musl's libm, so it is IEEE-754 throughout — NaN in gives NaN out, a signed zero
keeps its sign, and subnormals are not flushed.

**Errors are values, and they are IEEE's.** There is no `errno` here and no
floating-point environment: a domain error is a NaN, a range error is an
infinity or a zero. `math_errhandling` is 0.

**There is no `long double`.** It is 113-bit quad on this target and every
operation on one is a compiler-rt call nothing provides, so the `l`-suffixed
half of `<math.h>` does not exist. `float` and `double` are both real, with
single-precision kernels rather than rounded doubles.

`math/ftoa.h` is the text half, which no other header offers:

```cpp
Option<f64> parse_f64(Str);                 // strtod, correctly rounded
Option<f64> scan_f64(Str, usize &used);     // the same, with strtod's endptr
Str fmt_f64(char *out, usize cap, f64, i32 prec = -1, char style = 'g');
Str fmt_f64_padded(char *out, usize cap, f64, i32 prec, char style,
                   i32 width, Str flags);
Str fmt_f64_shortest(char *out, usize cap, f64);
Buf<N> &put_f64(Buf<N> &, f64, i32 prec = -1, char style = 'g');
```

`style` is one of `f e g a` and their capitals and `prec` is printf's, with -1
its default of six; these are musl's `strtod` and `printf` engines, so a
conversion is exactly the one a Unix program expects. `fmt_f64_shortest` names
a double in the fewest digits that read back to it bit-for-bit.

`fmt_f64_padded` is the same conversion with printf's field width and flags —
`flags` holds the characters `#`, `0`, `-`, ` ` and `+`, in any order — because
a zero pad goes *inside* the sign and no padding around a finished conversion
can produce that. It is a second function rather than two more defaulted
parameters so that `--gc-sections` drops it whole from a binary that never asks
for a width. `/bin/seq` is what calls it.

**A program pays only for what it calls** — `--gc-sections` never extracts an
unreferenced archive member. `sqrt` alone costs 309 bytes, since it is one wasm
instruction; `exp` 3.1 KB, `sin` and `cos` together 5.3 KB, `pow` 8.3 KB, and
twelve transcendentals at once 24 KB.

### What the headers do *not* contain

`include/braam/kernel/` and `include/braam/fs/` are shipped because the
libraries' headers include them, and they are worth reading — `str.h`,
`string.h`, `vec.h`, `span.h`, `result.h`, `fmt.h`, `text.h`, `path.h` and
`math/math.h` are the whole standard library here. But the parts of them that
name the scheduler, the host imports or the VFS belong to the kernel and have
nothing behind them in a program: reaching one is a link error, which is the
intended answer.

---

## 7. The rules that bite

These come from Concept.md §2 and §C.3, and each of them is a compile error, a
link error or a trap rather than a warning:

- **No exceptions and no RTTI.** Errors are `Result<T, E>`.
- **No libc by default.** No `malloc`, no `memcpy` you did not write, no
  `<cstring>`. `-nostdlib -nostdinc++` is not negotiable, and a construct
  needing a compiler-rt builtin — 128-bit division, an outlined `memcpy`,
  anything `long double` — will not link. There *is* a libm: `braam::math`, §6.
  A program being **ported** from Unix may opt into `braam::compat`, which
  changes nothing for one that does not: doc/Compat.md.
- **Never `new` anything.** `operator new` returns null on failure and there are
  no exceptions, so the expression would construct at address zero. Use
  `heap_new` and `heap_delete` from `kernel/alloc.h`.
- **A namespace-scope global must be trivially destructible.** A non-trivial
  destructor pulls in `__cxa_atexit`, which nothing provides. Make the state a
  POD, or put it behind a pointer built on first use.
- **Keep coroutine frames small.** A frame past 512 bytes costs a whole 64 KiB
  span from the allocator's top size class. Long-lived state belongs in a heap
  block the frame points at, not in the frame.
- **The memory cap is 16 MB**, and it is the kernel's number, not the binary's:
  `--import-memory` with no declared maximum means the host supplies the
  `Memory` and its ceiling.

## 8. The worker

**Your program runs in a Web Worker of its own**, and `braam_add_program`
arranges that with nothing asked of you. It is what every program in `/bin`
gets, `/bin/sh` included. What it buys is `worker.terminate()`: a kill that does
not need the program's cooperation, so a bug that loops for ever costs a command
rather than the session.

The cost is that every syscall becomes two `postMessage` hops rather than a call
— 34–45 µs measured, paid per read — so a program that reads a large file pays
it per `SYS_READ_MAX` if it names a length and per `SYS_CHUNK` if it does not
(`read_chunk` names one), and one being typed into pays it per round trip its
editor makes. There is no way to opt out and nothing to opt out to: a program is
a worker, and the answer to a program that costs too much in round trips is to
make fewer of them. The shell was the last to ask for an exception, and cutting
its round trips was the cheaper answer than weakening its isolation.

You do not have to handle the case where the host has no workers to give,
either. Your program simply has not started yet: the kernel backs off and asks
again — 10 ms, then 20, up to a second — printing `no worker, retrying` on its
stderr, and starts it the moment one can be had. There is nothing to detect and
no degraded mode to write for.

---

## 9. Versioning

The stamp carries a process-ABI number, and the kernel checks it before it runs
anything. `stamp.py` reads that number out of the `kernel/sysabi.h` the SDK
shipped, so a binary is stamped with the ABI of the headers it was actually
built against — never a restated constant that could fall behind.

That is what makes a mismatch a sentence rather than a crash:

```
$ ./hello
sh: hello: built for another process ABI
```

The answer is to rebuild against the SDK that matches the system.
`not executable` is the other one, and it means the file has no stamp at all and
no `#!` line either — an ordinary `.wasm` from somewhere else, a stamp that was
stripped, or a script whose interpreter is missing.

The ABI changes when the syscall table does, and both are documented in
Concept.md §4.3.

---

## 10. Checking a binary by hand

The build produces a module with an exact surface, and it is worth knowing what
it is, because a link that accidentally pulled in kernel code shows up here
first:

- **Imports** are `env.memory`, `kernel.sys` and `kernel.sys_async` — and
  nothing else. Any other import means the process ABI has been gone around.
  `sys_async` is absent from a program that never awaits.
- **Exports** are exactly `_alloc`, `_free`, `_resume`, `_start`. `memory` is
  *imported*, not exported, which is what makes the cap the kernel's.
- **One custom section named `braam`**, five little-endian `u32`s: magic
  `0x6d617262`, the ABI, flags, the initial pages and the maximum.

```
$ node -e 'const m=new WebAssembly.Module(require("fs").readFileSync("build/hello.wasm"));
  console.log(WebAssembly.Module.imports(m).map(i=>i.module+"."+i.name));
  console.log(WebAssembly.Module.exports(m).map(e=>e.name));
  console.log(new Uint32Array(WebAssembly.Module.customSections(m,"braam")[0]))'
```

In the Braam source tree, `test/system/abi.mjs` asserts all of that for every
binary, and will do it for a binary of yours if you hand it one:

```
node test/run.mjs --kernel build/kernel.wasm build/web/rootfs.zip /path/to/hello.wasm
```

## 11. Where to read next

- [System_Calls.md](System_Calls.md) — the mechanism end to end: the deferred
  step, the staging protocol, cancellation, the kill, and the whole syscall
  table in one place.
- [Concept.md](Concept.md) — the specification. §4.3 is the process ABI, §4.4 is
  what a process costs, §4.5 is the shell's language, §2 is the three invariants
  everything else follows from.
- [Shell.md](Shell.md) — the shell as a user sees it, which is the long form of
  §4 above: the grammar, the expansions, the twenty-six builtins, the jobs and
  what is deliberately absent.
- `src/cmd/` in the source tree — thirty-six worked examples, from `true.cpp` at
  six lines to the shell.
